[0:00:00.000] We have some breaking news to bring you. Huntington's disease has been successfully
[0:00:04.800] treated for the first time according to the results of a trial that has just been released.
[0:00:09.760] This disease is one of the worst genetic disorders. It's often described as a mixture
[0:00:14.480] of dementia, Parkinson's and motor neuron disease. Here in the UK, it affects around 7,000 people.
[0:00:20.160] Now, if you inherit the gene from either parent, there is a 50% chance you will develop it,
[0:00:25.840] usually developing it in middle age. The trial was shown to slow the progress of the disease by
[0:00:31.680] 75%. So with me now is our medical editor Fergus Walsh and Professor Edward Wilde,
[0:00:37.360] who is a consultant neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and a
[0:00:41.680] Huntington's disease specialist. Isn't it great to see you both talking about this story? And
[0:00:47.119] Fergus, we are always so careful to use that word breakthrough. It's rare I use it. But we can,
[0:00:52.880] I have had to pinch myself on this story a little bit in your intro. If you inherit this gene
[0:01:00.799] from one of your parents, there's 100% chance you will go on to develop Huntington's disease.
[0:01:09.120] So when couples have a child, there's a 50-50 chance that it'll be passed on. But this trial,
[0:01:15.839] and these are just the top line results, so we need to always be cautious until they're
[0:01:21.040] published in a peer-reviewed journal. But they are sensational. Edward's involved,
[0:01:26.720] he'll tell you much more. I feel bad even talking before him. But let me just give you the outline.
[0:01:33.279] 29 patients. They had a one-off treatment, which was an injection into six parts of the brain,
[0:01:42.400] deep into the brain. And the three-year data shows that of the 29 patients involved,
[0:01:49.919] the average slowing of the disease was 75%. And that was based on measures like cognition,
[0:02:00.239] movement, ability to lead an independent life. And given that this awful disease often takes
[0:02:08.720] 10 to 20 years to kill someone once symptoms emerge, potentially, that could give them
[0:02:15.199] decades, years certainly, but decades more healthy life. So it's extraordinary. It's not
[0:02:20.399] licensed yet. But I'm thrilled for researchers like Ed, and also for the families. I've met quite
[0:02:28.240] a few of the families. And they are living under the shadow of this terrible condition.
[0:02:34.479] And so it's fantastic news. Ed, as Fergus was speaking, I mean, I just
[0:02:39.199] went goose lumpy. But then I looked across at your face, and you are looking so utterly thrilled,
[0:02:43.919] as you should be. I mean, can you give me a reaction from you and the team when you started
[0:02:48.639] to see these kinds of results come through? I'm probably slightly more prone to excitement
[0:02:55.759] than Fergus on things like this. But it really is breathtaking. And it's unlike anything we've
[0:03:00.800] ever seen before. I've been doing Huntington's disease research and looking after patients with
[0:03:05.520] HD for 20 years. And trial after trial after trial has, you know, we've been in the world of
[0:03:12.080] incremental progress. But each individual trial has ended in disappointment and a negative result.
[0:03:18.160] We know what we need to achieve, though. We know the cause of Huntington's disease. And that's what
[0:03:22.240] gave us the head start. And this gene therapy news is really the first time in the history of
[0:03:29.279] Huntington's disease that we have convincingly slowed the progression of Huntington's disease.
[0:03:34.479] And we have biochemical evidence that the mechanism is through rescuing neurons, protecting neurons
[0:03:41.199] from dying, which they would otherwise do. Okay, so tell us a bit more about how it works,
[0:03:45.039] why it's so effective. So the gene therapy is an inactivated virus, which is injected deep into
[0:03:51.279] the brain, a part of the brain called the striatum. It's a long neurosurgical procedure. So
[0:03:57.039] there's a lot of upfront work and risk. Once the gene therapy has been delivered to the brain,
[0:04:03.679] that's it. It's there, the virus gets into the neurons and injects a piece of DNA. And it
[0:04:10.000] basically reprograms the neuron to become a factory for its own cure. So the neuron is producing
[0:04:18.559] the harmful protein, but it's also producing a molecule which halts production of that protein.
[0:04:24.160] And that must be how we've slowed the disease. There's less harm happening and the disease is
[0:04:32.160] slower. And just to be clear, Fergus, up until now, doctors have only been able to manage the
[0:04:37.760] symptoms. Yeah, there's been no treatment for Huntington's disease. This holds the promise
[0:04:45.040] that not only will you be able to slow it down in patients who are affected in the early stages,
[0:04:53.040] but yesterday I met a 30-year-old man whose father died of Huntington's disease, saw him
[0:05:01.040] gradually fade away, needing full-time care, and died at the age of 54.
[0:05:07.040] There's hope that he will be able to have the treatment and others and never get affected.
[0:05:13.920] I mean, it's as big as that. Now, I should put this, we've got to be cautious. It's not a licensed
[0:05:18.320] treatment. It'll be expensive. Another gene therapy, a one-off treatment. Like a million
[0:05:26.399] pounds sometimes? Probably maybe more than two million. But if you think of the cost,
[0:05:32.640] Huntington's disease tends to come on when people have just had their children,
[0:05:38.480] they then need full-time care. It's a huge cost to those families and to society.
[0:05:45.440] So I would hope the NHS would see this as something that is worth paying for. But obviously,
[0:05:55.440] there are lots of other demands on the NHS. But we're way ahead of ourselves. I think for
[0:06:00.000] the moment, for today, we should just celebrate the research. A momentous day. Congratulations.
[0:06:05.119] Thank you. Congratulations to the global Huntington's disease community. This result
[0:06:09.760] belongs to everyone. That is a lovely way to end it. Thank you, Professor Edward Wildenfergus.
[0:06:13.679] Always good to see you. Thank you.
