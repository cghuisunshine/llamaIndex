Upon completing the registration, the respective sponsor will be notified to review and approve/deny the apprentice\u2019s registration request. \n\n### Sponsor Initiated\n\nSponsors may initiate the apprenticeship registration process on behalf of their apprentice through the Online Registration section in the Portal. They will need the apprentice\u2019s SkilledTradesBC ID to start the process. Upon completing the registration, the respective apprentice will be notified to review and approve/deny the sponsor\u2019s registration request.   \n  \nThis guide outlines the steps apprentices can follow to initiate their apprenticeship program registration with the SkilledTradesBC. \n\n## Online Registration\n\nTo start the registration process, apprentices can navigate to the My Registration section on the left side of the SkilledTradesBC Portal dashboard.   \n  \nClick My Registration. \n\n![](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/KB-apprentice_initiated_1.jpg)\n\nClick the + Online Registration button in the top right corner. \n\n![](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/KB-apprentice_initiated_1.jpg)\n\nThe New Online Registration page is displayed. \n\n![](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/KB-apprentice_initiated_2.jpg)\n\n## New Online Apprenticeship Registration - Apprentice Initiated\n\nTo register for an apprenticeship program, apprentices must have the following information: \n\n  * Trade Name\n  * Program Name\n  * Sponsor ID of their employer\n\n\n\n![](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/KB-apprentice_initiated_2.jpg)\n\n### Choose Trade Program \n\nChoose the trade that you would like to register for from the drop-down menu. \n\n![](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/KB-online_registration_manual_1.jpg)\n\nIf an apprentice is already registered for the selected trade, an error message will appear and notify the apprentice that they may not proceed with the registration for the selected trade. \n\n![](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/KB-online_registration_manual_2.jpg)\n\n### Choose Program\n\nChoose the apprenticeship program that you would like to register for.\n\n![](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/KB-online_registration_manual_3.jpg)\n\n### Sponsor ID\n\nEnter your sponsor organization\u2019s SkilledTradesBC ID. The system will validate the SkilledTradesBC ID to ensure it exists. Upon validation, the organization name will be populated. Check the organization\u2019s name to ensure it is correct.\n\n![](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/KB-online_registration_manual_4.jpg)\n\nIf an apprentice does not have their sponsor\u2019s SkilledTradesBC ID, they may: \n\n  1. Resume the registration process later \n  2. Provide their SkilledTradesBC ID to their sponsor and have the sponsor add them as an apprentice through the Portal.\n\n\n\nApprentices can locate their SkilledTradesBC ID by navigating to the My Profile section. \n\n![](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/KB-online_registration_manual_11.jpg)\n\nIf an apprentice does not have a sponsor, they may contact the SkilledTradesBC for assistance. \n\n### Out of Province Experience\n\nIf an apprentice does not have any experience in a different province in the selected trade, select No. \n\n![](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/KB-online_registration_manual_5.jpg)\n\nIf an apprentice has experience in the selected trade in a different province, they must select Yes. \n\n![](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/KB-online_registration_manual_6.jpg)\n\nThey will then be prompted to enter the Province\u2019s name and their Provincial ID. \n\n### Apprentice Attestation\n\nRead the Apprentice Attestation and check the attestation box.   \n  \nClick Submit. \n\n![](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/KB-online_registration_manual_7.jpg)\n\nApprentices are notified once the submission is successful. Their sponsor will then receive a notification to approve the apprentice\u2019s registration. Sponsors have 30 days to review and approve the registration.   \n  \nSkilledTradesBC may review the apprenticeship registration if required.   \n  \nBoth the apprentice and the sponsor will be notified upon successful completion of the process. \n\n![](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/KB-online_registration_manual_8.jpg)\n\n### Active Online Registrations\n\nUpon successful submission, the registration request can be viewed on the Active Online Registrations section. \n\n![](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/KB-online_registration_manual_9.jpg)\n\nThe registration request appears under the Active Online Registrations table.
