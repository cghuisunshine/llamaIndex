Then click **+Change Sponsor**.\n\n![](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/KB-app_reg_change_sponsor_1.jpg)\n\nSelect the program you are registered into from the drop-down menu and click **Change Registration**.\n\n![](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/KB-app_reg_change_sponsor_2.jpg)\n\nEnter your new employer\u2019s SkilledTradesBC ID.\n\n**DO NOT** include the \u201c0\u201d in front as it does not bring up the organization.\n\nThe system will validate the SkilledTradesBC ID to ensure it exists. Upon validation, check the box to confirm change and submit.\n\n![](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/KB-app_reg_change_sponsor_3.jpg)\n\nYou are notified once the submission is successful. Your sponsor will then receive a notification to approve your registration. They have 30 days to review and approve your registration.\n\n![](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/KB-app_reg_change_sponsor_4.jpg)\n\nUpon Sponsor\u2019s review and submission, SkilledTradesBC may review the apprenticeship registration if required. This process might take up to 24 hours to complete.\n\n![](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/KB-app_reg_change_sponsor_5.jpg)\n\nBoth the apprentice and the sponsor will be notified upon successful completion of the process.\n\nKeywords: My Apprenticeship, Online Registration, SkilledTradesBC Portal\n\n__\n\n### Are you working to be an Apprentice?\n\nIf you're ready to register\n\n[Click Here](/online-registration-create-edit/?type=apprentice)\n\n**Please contact your organization and request that they add you as an Authorized Staff or if you would like to create a new sponsor organization, please choose \"Create an Organization\" in the left navigation under the My Activities section.**\n\nOk\n", "links": ["https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/", "https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn?returnUrl=%2F", "https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/all-notifications/", "https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/contact-us", "https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/", "https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/article/KA-01301/en-us", "https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/article/KA-01301/en-us#stc-main", "https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/online-registration-create-edit/?type=apprentice", "https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/terms-and-conditions-of-use", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exams-certification-distribution-potentially-impacted-bcgeu-job-action"]}
