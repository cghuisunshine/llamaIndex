We highly recommend that you ensure each staff has their own individual account and avoid sharing accounts in order to keep your account secure and for actions to be traced.\n\n**Primary Contact:** This individual is the **main administrator** for your organization\u2019s account who manages the organizational information for your account, in addition to apprenticeship reporting. The Primary Contact will also receive important system emails and alerts from SkilledTradesBC and any account updates and sponsor communications.\n\n**Authorized Staff:** These individuals are **secondary users** for your account and their main task is typically to report work-based training hours for apprentices. Multiple Authorized Staff can be added to an organization\u2019s account. They have limited functionality and do not have permission to manage or change the organization\u2019s account information.\n\nThis table below shows what each user type can do:\n\n![](/knowledgebase/prim_contact_auth_staff_table.png)\n\n#### Need help?\n\nContact us by:\n\n  * Submit inquiries through **\"My Sponsor Inquiries\u201d**\n  * Email: [customerservice@skilledtradesbc.ca](mailto:customerservice@skilledtradesbc.ca)\n  * Phone: 778 328 8700 / **Toll Free in British Columbia:** [1 866 660 6011](tel:18666606011)\n\n\n\n__\n\n### Are you working to be an Apprentice?\n\nIf you're ready to register\n\n[Click Here](/online-registration-create-edit/?type=apprentice)\n\n**Please contact your organization and request that they add you as an Authorized Staff or if you would like to create a new sponsor organization, please choose \"Create an Organization\" in the left navigation under the My Activities section.**\n\nOk\n", "links": ["https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/", "https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn?returnUrl=%2F", "https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/all-notifications/", "https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/contact-us", "https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/", "https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/article/KA-01330/en-us", "https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/article/KA-01330/en-us#stc-main", "https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/online-registration-create-edit/?type=apprentice", "https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/terms-and-conditions-of-use", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exams-certification-distribution-potentially-impacted-bcgeu-job-action"]}
