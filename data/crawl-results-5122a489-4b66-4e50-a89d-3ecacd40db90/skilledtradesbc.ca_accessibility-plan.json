Empower employees to build an accessible and inclusive workplace culture through continuous learning.    \n\n\n2\\. Create and review policies, guidelines and procedures regarding accessibility and accommodations.   \n\n\n3\\. Ensure equal access to information by delivering clear communications and improving digital tools.\n\n  \n4\\.

This training includes:\n    * Words Matter: This training supports BC Public Service employees by providing guidelines for using inclusive language in the workplace.\n    * Gender-Based Analysis Plus (GBA+) : Implemented by the Government of Canada, this training helps develop responsive and inclusive policies, programs, and other initiatives, involving a gender and diversity-sensitive approach.  \n\n  * We host regular lunch and learn sessions to provide learning opportunities for employees. Topics include, but are not limited to, learning disabilities, neurodivergence and Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  \n\n  * We developed mandatory Indigenous inclusion and cultural competency training for employees. 100 per cent of employees completed this training to better serve Indigenous apprentices and partners.  \n\n  * We partnered with an equity, inclusion and anti-racism consulting company to deliver an expanded learning series for employees. Employees participated in five mandatory learning sessions to date.  \n\n  * We conducted a diversity and inclusion audit through a third party to better understand the organization\u2019s demographics, diversity and accessibility needs.   \n\n\n\n\n**Next steps:**\n\n  * Create an organizational learning plan that includes targeted inclusion, diversity, equity and accessibility topics to increase accessibility awareness and understanding.  \n\n  * Conduct a survey to assess employees\u2019 knowledge, perceptions and behaviours as it relates to accessibility. \n\n\n\nCreate and review policies, guidelines and procedures regarding accessibility and accommodations. \n\n  \n**Actions to date:**\n\n  * We review and update our Employee Handbook every year to ensure the policies, processes and guidelines are current and relevant. All employees must review and sign the updated handbooks and are encouraged to provide feedback on the updates to foster continuous improvement.   \n\n  * We offer a hybrid work model to provide employees with the flexibility to work remotely up to three days per week. This empowers employees to decide where and how they work, ensuring they can achieve a better work-life balance that meets their individual needs and preferences. It also supports employees with mobility challenges or other accessibility needs by reducing commuting stress.   \n\n  * We have dedicated teams and streamlined processes to provide robust supports that guide apprentices and tradespeople throughout their skilled trades journey. This includes:  \n\n    * **Regional Supports**  \nWe have dedicated Apprenticeship Advisors and Certification Advisors located across the province to provide hands-on, direct support to apprentices, employers and sponsors, helping them navigate the skilled trades training environment.   \n\n    * **Programs for Underrepresented Groups**  \nWe work with Indigenous communities, school districts, training partners, industry and government to fund a range of programs that support the participation and retention of youth, Indigenous peoples, women, newcomers and other equity-deserving groups in skilled trades apprenticeships and careers. View trades training programs available to[ Equity-Deserving Groups and Indigenous Peoples. ](https://skilledtradesbc.ca/equity-in-the-trades)  \n\n    * **Completions Supports**  \nWe provide personalized one-on-one guidance for apprentices and tradespeople facing barriers to certification. This includes providing tailored accommodation and support solutions that cater to individual needs and learning styles.  \n\n    * **Exam Preparation and Study Tips**  \nWe offer exam preparation and study tips to support for apprentices to review important information and share best practices to help them succeed. This includes after-hours sessions so that individuals with work or other commitments can participate. View [Exam Preparation and Study Tips.](https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/exam-study-support)   \n\n    * **Exam Accommodations**  \nWe offer exam accommodations tailored to individual needs to create a fair and inclusive testing environment that ensures everyone has the supports they need to successfully complete their exam. Tradespeople can apply for these accommodations online, through the customer Portal, and/or by contacting our customer service team. We also streamlined our process for requesting accommodations, eliminating the need for a medical note.
