Watch the video below to learn more.\n\nWhile September is traditionally the \u2018back to school\u2019 season, January is also a critical point in the education calendar. This is usually the point where students and their parents/guardians can make some critical decisions about their education pathway for the next school year (starting in the fall). \n\nFor some high school students \u2013 this may be researching options into starting their skilled trades journey. This could mean taking their technical training or beginning their apprenticeship. If you aren\u2019t familiar with SkilledTradesBC Youth in Trade programs, here is a helpful video from Maureen Phung, Manager of Youth Programs who provides an overview and answers some commonly asked questions. \n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n**How does a youth get an apprenticeship?**\n\nThere\u2019s a range of ways a youth can get an apprenticeship. School career educators and programs will help young people learn how to create a resume and prepare for interviews. From there we encourage individuals to use jobs boards and resources like [WorkBC](https://www.workbc.ca/) centres, attend hiring fairs or similar type of events or they can even reach out to family, friends and other adults about potential apprenticeship opportunities. Some schools have list of employers that they might suggest as well. Taking advantage of a school\u2019s Work Experience program is another great way for youth to find an apprenticeship.   \n\n\n**What trades are available?**\n\nWe have [nearly 90 different trades](https://skilledtradesbc.ca/find-your-trade) that individuals can take part in but some trades may only be offered or more readily available in certain regions of B.C.   \n\n\n**What kind of time commitment is the Youth Program?**\n\nThe time comment for a Youth program will vary depending on the program selected and the trade selected but it can range from 1 high school course to 1 year long programs.  \n\n\n**What is the advantage of starting in high school?**\n\nThe advantage of starting in high school is that youth can get a head start on their apprenticeship. We often see youth entering their 2nd level or even 3rd level of their apprenticeship by the time they graduate! Another advantage is that the cost of tuition for these programs are covered!\n\nYouth Trade Programs\n\nSkilledTradesBC Youth Trade Programs let you get started in a trade while you\u2019re still in high school.
