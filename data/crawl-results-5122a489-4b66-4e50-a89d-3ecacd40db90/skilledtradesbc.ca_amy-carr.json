She fell in love with metal, with the reward of taking the flat sheets and turning them into anything needed or wanted was both challenging and impressive to her.\n\nHer first job in sheet metal was in 2012, and she\u2019s worked on a number of rewarding projects over the years in Victoria, where she was born and raised, including the Tapestry building, Boom and Batten restaurant, the Empress Hotel, and the Hudson Market.\n\n\u201cI sound like that 60-year-old dad who drives down the road and says, \u2018I did that, I built that,\u2019\u201d laughs Amy. \u201cBut once the project is completed it\u2019s so rewarding.\u201d\n\nWhile her career started with the hands-on work needed to develop her skills and reputation, over the years she\u2019s had opportunities to shift and progress, obtained her Red Seal in 2018, and is now being trained to be a junior foreman.\n\nAs a woman in a trades profession, she\u2019s seen lots of positive change in eight years \u2013 such as being taken seriously by other trades and their foremen, far more support on site \u2013 but there\u2019s much more still needed.\n\n\u201cWhat needs to change is employers need to unlock their doors and let more women in,\u201d says Amy. \u201cEmployers still look at a name on a resume and assume \u2018she\u2019 can\u2019t do the work. Women have to put a \u2018male\u2019 name on the resume and they get the interview that way. People should stop being shocked that women can do this work; I knew one foreman whose wife didn\u2019t like him working with other women. We\u2019re not there to date foremen, we\u2019re there to  _be_ one.\u201d\n\nWhile women are gaining more allies on construction job sites, she says that having a good mentor and support system can be critical for women. Tradeswomen need someone to help teach and support them, whether male or female, Amy insists.\n\nSome of the biggest support she\u2019s had on site were her union brothers and allies, she says, and appreciates everyone who is a true ally.\n\n\u201cThose who never question your ability because of your gender is huge,\u201d Amy says. \u201cI think the more we bring the men into this and give them pats on the back, because it\u2019s so new for them, the better it will be for everyone.\u201d\n\n> _\u201cI know when I was going through my apprenticeship that I wished there was a female I could talk to, that I could feel comfortable asking questions of; I never thought I\u2019d see the day when I\u2019d have a female apprentice and I do now and it\u2019s so cool.\u201d_\n\nAs only one of two women working in sheet metal in her union when she joined, it was the one thing she wishes she had been given during her apprenticeship. She herself now makes a point to connect together other women in her union and network so that they have the support she could have used.\n\nIn fact, Amy herself is stepping up to bring other women as they launch their trades careers.\n\n\u201cI know when I was going through my apprenticeship that I wished there was a female I could talk to, that I could feel comfortable asking questions of; I never thought I\u2019d see the day when I\u2019d have a female apprentice and I do now and it\u2019s so cool.\u201d\n\nWhile Amy started her trades career with a hands on profession that she loves, she\u2019s starting to look ahead to the next steps in her career, possibly with her union, with the BC Centre for Women in the Trades or the SkilledTradesBC.\n\n\u201cThe possibilities are endless once you learn this stuff. I\u2019d like to use my voice to advocate in some way, either for union or Women in the trades.\u201d\n", "links": ["https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc-corporate-reports/public-interest-disclosure-act", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc/corporate-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/employment-training-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/indigenous-youth", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades/skilledtradesbc-news-feed", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/accessibility-plan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/amy-carr#main-content", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/annual-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/apprentice-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/are-you-impacted", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/become-an-apprentice", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canada-apprentice-loans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canadian-and-military-certificate-holders", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/careers-at-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-certification-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-level-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-skilled-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/contact-us", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/disclaimer", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/employment-insurance", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/equity-in-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-accommodations", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-results", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-rewrites", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-schedule", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/experienced-workers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/find-your-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/fees-payments", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/verify-tradespersons-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/foundation-programs", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/freedom-of-information", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/general-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-about-exams/exam-study-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-skilled-trades-certification/self-assessment-forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/about-exams", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/newcomers-international-tradespersons", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/govt-mandate-letter", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/grants", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/indigenous-people-in-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/labour-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/leadership-team", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/level-challengers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/new-supports-skilled-trades-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/open-data", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/personal-info-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/policies-and-bylaws", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/privacy-policy", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement/supplier-complaint-review-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/quarterly-statistical-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/request-for-review", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/service-plans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/skilledtradescertification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sponsor-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/start-an-apprenticeship", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-information-session-events", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-resources", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-trades-designation-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/strategicplan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/success-stories", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/tax-credits", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-programs-underrepresented-groups", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-providers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/truth-and-reconciliation", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/what-to-expect-on-exam-day", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/youth"]}
