They remove layers of old coatings, match colours and mix paints, prepare surfaces for painting, apply primers, sealers, base coats, single-stage and clear coats, clean and polish painted surfaces, and apply protective coatings. Many Automotive Refinishing Technicians work in close contact with Auto Body and Collision Technicians. Automotive refinishing duties may overlap between the two, particularly in small shops. In larger places of employment, Automotive Refinishing Technicians likely work as specialists, after body repairs have been completed. They may also work with estimators, partspersons, detailers, preppers, glass installers and production managers.
