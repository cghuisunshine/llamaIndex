Indigenous Apprenticeship Forum, bringing together members of the skilled trades community for a groundbreaking three-day event.\n\nLast month, the first ever B.C. Indigenous Apprentice Forum kicked off at the Delta Hotel & Conference Centre in Burnaby gathering members of the skilled trades community. This inaugural three-day conference (April 30 \u2013 May 2) fostered vital discussions, shared invaluable learnings, and celebrated notable successes, all with the goal of advancing opportunities for Indigenous apprenticeships. SkilledTradesBC worked collaboratively with the [B.C. Aboriginal Training Employment Alliance Members (BCATEAM)](https://bcateam.ca/) on the planning committee, providing support and guidance when needed. \n\nThe seeds of this conference started a year ago after the 2023 [Canadian Apprenticeship Forum (CAF)](https://caf-fca.org/) where the need for a dedicated forum on Indigenous apprenticeship experience was identified. In response, a committee led by the BCATEAM, representing 15 Indigenous Skills Employment and Training Strategy (ISETS) programs, was formed to bring this inaugural event to fruition.\n\nOver the course of three days, there were panels, off-site tours, presentations, and networking opportunities that reflected the different audience groups in the Indigenous apprenticeship journey. The first day began with SkilledTradesBC (represented by CEO, Shelley Gray) and members from the BCATEAM solidifying their partnership with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The MOU is based on the principles of [_Truth and Reconciliation 94 Calls to Action_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/indigenous-people/new-relationship/truth-and-reconciliation-commission-calls-to-action) , [_Declaration of Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act (DRIPA),_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/indigenous-people/new-relationship/united-nations-declaration-on-the-rights-of-indigenous-peoples) and [_United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)_](http://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2018/11/UNDRIP_E_web.pdf) , to engage in an impactful partnership to ensure Indigenous inclusion and input resulting in successful opportunities in the trades. \n\nDuring the conference, there was a strong emphasis on the significant work of ISETS across the province in helping Indigenous peoples prepare, train and find sustainable jobs and careers. Other voices included unions, corporate sponsors and training providers. The diverse nature of participants made for dynamic conversations and connections \u2013 attendees were energized by the opportunities to converse directly with representatives immediately rather than setting up meetings in the future; utilizing the energy and momentum of the conference. A unique aspect of the conference was that on the second day, attendees visited different off-site locations with complimentary bus transport to experience trades training in action. Some of the locations included: union shops, [British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT)](https://www.bcit.ca/), and[ Seaspan](https://www.seaspan.com/), along with impressive trade simulators available for attendees to try. \n\nOverall, the conference fostered collaboration and highlighted the importance of everyone\u2019s collective efforts towards inclusive growth in the skilled trades industry. SkilledTradesBC remains committed to working with our Indigenous partners and communities to support and promote Indigenous apprenticeship and success. \n\nThe Forum was made possible through the collaborative support and efforts of partners, funders and sponsors:\n\n  * [British Columbia Aboriginal Training Employment Alliance Members (BCATEAM)](https://www.accessfutures.com/)[Aboriginal Community Career Employment Services Society (ACCESS)  ](https://accessfutures.com/)\n\n  * [Coast Salish Employment and Training Society (CSETS](https://csets.com/))\n\n  * [Okanagan Training & Development Council (OTDC) ](https://www.otdc.org/)\n\n  * [Prince George Nechako Aboriginal Employment & Training Association (PGNAETA) ](https://www.pgnaeta.bc.ca/)\n\n  * [Cariboo Chilcotin Aboriginal Training & Employment Centre (CCATEC) ](https://ccatec.com/)\n\n  * [Shuswap Nation Tribal Council (SNTC) ](https://shuswapnation.org/)\n\n  * [Sto:Lo Aboriginal Skills and Employment Training (SASET) ](https://www.stolonation.bc.ca/)\n\n  * [Tribal Resources Investment Corporation (TRICORP) ](https://www.tricorp.ca/tricorp)\n\n  * [Ktunaxa Nation Employment and Training (KNET) ](https://knet.ca/)\n\n  * [North East Native Advancing Society (NENAS) ](https://www.nenas.org/about/)\n\n  * [BC Infrastructure Benenfits (BCIB) ](https://bcib.ca/)\n\n  * [New Relationship Trust ](https://newrelationshiptrust.ca/)\n\n  * [LNG Canada ](https://www.lngcanada.ca/)\n\n  * [Enbridge](https://www.enbridge.com/)\n\n  * [Service Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/portfolio/service-canada.html)\n\n  * [SkilledTradesBC](https://skilledtradesbc.ca/)\n\n  * The Government of Canada through the Canada-British Columbia Workforce Development Agreement. \n\n  * And more.\n\n\n\n\n_[Photo Above: April 30, 2024 -
