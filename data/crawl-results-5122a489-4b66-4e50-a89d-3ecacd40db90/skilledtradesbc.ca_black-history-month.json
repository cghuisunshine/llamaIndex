This year's theme is \"Black Legacy and Leadership: Celebrating Canadian History and Uplifting Future Generations.\" \n\nFrom the Government of Canada on Black history in Canada:\n\n_\u201cThe history of Black communities in Canada is an integral part of Canadian history. This year\u2019s theme is about reflecting and celebrating the contributions of Black Canadians in shaping our country while paving the way for a more equitable and inclusive future._\n\n_In Canada, diversity is a fact, but inclusion is a choice; for far too long Black communities in Canada have been faced with anti-Black and systemic racism. Our government has remained committed to combatting these systemic barriers, and that is why we recognized the United Nations International Decade for People of African Descent and welcomed the recently announced second decade._\n\n_Through efforts like the Canada Anti-Racism Strategy and Canada\u2019s Action Plan on Combatting Hate, our government is tackling anti-Black racism and combatting hate in all its forms. Black History Month offers us all a valuable opportunity to learn more about the diversity of Black communities across the country, and to listen to and be open with one another on what we can do to build a better, more inclusive Canada._ \u201d\n\nIn this blog post, we highlight notable Black Canadians who were not only tradespersons, but individuals who made important contributions to the civil rights and the fight against racial discrimination. \n\n**Viola Desmond**\n\n![viola desmond](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Viola_Desmond.jpg)Born in 1914 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Viola Desmond was an entrepreneur and mentor to young Black women. She attended beauty school and earned a diploma from the Apex College of Beauty Culture and Hairdressing in Atlantic City. Viola saw the need for hair products and training specifically for Black women and created her own line of hair and skin products, specifically catered for them. She also opened up her own salon in 1937 and founded the Desmond School of Beauty Culture, where she accepted and trained Black apprentices to become master beauticians and businesswomen. \n\nViola is well known for her role in challenging racial discrimination when she refused to leave the segregated Whites-only section of the Roseland Theatre in Nova Scotia, leading to her arrest, imprisonment, and conviction for a tax offence. Her refusal to submit to racial discrimination has inspired countless others and eventually in 2010, Lieutenant Governor Mayann Francis issued Viola a free pardon. \n\n**Emmitt Holmes**\n\nEmmitt Homes was born in 1924, immigrating to British Columbia from Saskatchewan in the 1940s. He was a carpenter by trade and was the only black member of the Vancouver Local of the International Woodworkers of America when he first joined in 1944. Throughout the 1950s, he represented the union at multiple events and conventions both within the province and internationally, and served as the IWA\n\ndelegate to the Vancouver Labour Council. \n\nEmmitt joined and became the chair of the Joint Labor Committee to Combat![Newspaper clipping from The Province. Pictured: delgates attending the International Woodworkers Convention, B.C. section, at Victoria in 1951.](/sites/default/files/inline-images/holmes-4-768x797.jpg) Racial Discrimination for 14 years, where he joined other activists in fighting prejudice against Black individuals in British Columbia. His work included researching the discrimination faced by Black Canadians, writing a letter to the Vancouver Sun encouraging unity and equality of all races, and protesting police brutality that led to the death of Clarence Clemons. Emmitt eventually became the founding member of the BC Association for the Advancement of Coloured* People in 1956. \n\n*Historically, a racial descriptor used to describe African Americans during the Jim Crow era. \n\n**John Sullivan Deas**\n\nIn the early years of the salmon canning industry in British Columbia, John Sullivan Deas was a pioneer of this industry, founding the first commercial salmon cannery in British Columbia. John immigrated to Canada in 1862 from the United States and was a skilled tinsmith by trade. From 1874 to 1878, John operated the Deas Island Cannery, where they produced between 200,000 to 400,000 cans per year. These cans were eventually sold and shipped to England.\n\nIn 1878, John sold his cannery due to fierce competition amongst canneries along the Fraser River and moved to Portland, Oregon with his family. Today, though the Fraser River canneries have all closed, John\u2019s legacy lives on. His former cannery is now Deas Island Regional Park at the southern end of the George Massey Tunnel, originally known as the Deas Island Tunnel. \n\n**Learn more about Black Canadian History and more
