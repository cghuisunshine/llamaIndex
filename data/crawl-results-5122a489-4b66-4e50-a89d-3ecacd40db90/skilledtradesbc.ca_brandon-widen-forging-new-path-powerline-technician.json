From 2014 to 2018, he worked as a traffic control person (or flag person) on Vancouver Island, primarily working on BC Hydro sites. He was naturally curious, always striking up conversations with the crew and asking questions. Over time he learned a lot about how their electrical systems worked and how things operated. That\u2019s when it clicked\u2014this wasn\u2019t just something he was interested in, he wanted to be part of it, to explore a new career path. \n\nAs a member of the Witset First Nation (near Smithers, B.C.), Brandon qualified for BC Hydro\u2019s Try-a-Trade program for Indigenous participants. This free 16-week program included classroom learning and paid work placements. From the first day, he felt a sense of belonging. \u201cRight from orientation to meeting the crew \u2013 they were so welcoming, friendly and patient... they allowed me to learn at my own pace,\u201d shared Brandon.\n\nThe positive experience and hands-on work solidified his decision \u2013 he was going to pursue a career as a powerline technician.\n\nTo enroll in BC Hydro\u2019s PLT program, Brandon was glad he has completed high school prerequisites like Math 11, Physics 11 and English 12\u2014but for those who haven\u2019t, there are other pathways like upskilling courses to help get you on track. \n\nNow, Brandon is beginning his journey as powerline technician apprentice in Campbell River. He is already making great progress, eager to learn and grow every day. \u201cBrandon has a keen ability to absorb technical knowledge and apply it in on the job. What makes us proud is seeing him exactly where he wants to be \u2013 building a future in the skilled trades,\u201d shared his employer.\n\nBrandon\u2019s story is a reminder that it is never too late to change your career and pursue a new path. With nearly 90 trades to choose from\u2014there\u2019s no shortage of opportunity to find a career that fuels your passion.
