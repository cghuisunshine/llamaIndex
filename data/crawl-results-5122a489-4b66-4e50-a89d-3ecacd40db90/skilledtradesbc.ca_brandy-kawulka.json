The Red Seal cabinet maker and business owner was once a professional ballet dancer who toured Canada with the B.C. ballet.\n\nToday, she proudly calls herself \u2018head boss lady\u2019 of her own renovation and contracting company and says life-long learning is the key to success. \u201cOne needs to do a variety of things within their trade to be well rounded enough to consider shifting gears.\u201d\n\nWhen life in the ballet ended, Brandy went in search of a new career. \u201cI took an unofficial tour of the BCIT trades shops, because I missed the open house,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWhen I walked into the joinery shop, I just knew that\u2019s where I wanted to be. It\u2019s clean, its dry. You are not outside in the elements.\u201d\n\nBrandy worked as an apprentice while getting her joinery ticket and was eventually promoted to junior project management, drafting and estimating.\n\nShe and her husband launched \u201cWood Be Art,\u201d a small wood shop doing custom cabinetry. After the birth of their first child, Brandy returned to project management with her previous employer. She worked in the morning while her husband stayed home with the baby. In the afternoon, he went to their shop, and she took on child care.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the work life balance they\u2019d dreamed of, but she says it was a good transition while they built up the business. Five years ago, Brandy decided to devote her energies to Wood Be Art. She expanded the business, taking on a general contractor role and doing light commercial and residential renovations.\n\n\u201cNot everybody is meant for entrepreneurship. But anyone who has been in trades careers for a while will tell you that at some point your body is going to give out.\u201d \n\nShe urges skilled tradeswomen who are motivated to seize opportunities to gain new skills or education. \u201cTake a project management course to become a manager, foreman or site superintendent. Or add a second trade.\u201d\n\nFinding a work/life balance while raising two children and running a company is still challenging, but she says the rewards are worth it. \u201cWe almost always eat dinner together and do things as a family, like hiking and skiing. I try to be home by the time the kids are home from school, and often do office work in the evening...because it\u2019s my company and my day so I can schedule it to make it work for me!\u201d\n", "links": ["https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc-corporate-reports/public-interest-disclosure-act", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc/corporate-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/employment-training-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/indigenous-youth", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades/skilledtradesbc-news-feed", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/accessibility-plan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/annual-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/apprentice-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/are-you-impacted", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/become-an-apprentice", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/brandy-kawulka#main-content", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canada-apprentice-loans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canadian-and-military-certificate-holders", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/careers-at-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-certification-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-level-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-skilled-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/contact-us", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/disclaimer", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/employment-insurance", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/equity-in-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-accommodations", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-results", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-rewrites", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-schedule", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/experienced-workers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/find-your-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/fees-payments", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/verify-tradespersons-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/foundation-programs", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/freedom-of-information", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/general-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-about-exams/exam-study-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-skilled-trades-certification/self-assessment-forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/about-exams", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/newcomers-international-tradespersons", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/govt-mandate-letter", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/grants", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/indigenous-people-in-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/labour-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/leadership-team", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/level-challengers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/new-supports-skilled-trades-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/open-data", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/personal-info-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/policies-and-bylaws", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/privacy-policy", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement/supplier-complaint-review-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/quarterly-statistical-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/request-for-review", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/service-plans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/skilledtradescertification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sponsor-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/start-an-apprenticeship", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-information-session-events", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-resources", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-trades-designation-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/strategicplan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/success-stories", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/tax-credits", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-programs-underrepresented-groups", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-providers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/truth-and-reconciliation", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/what-to-expect-on-exam-day", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/youth"]}
