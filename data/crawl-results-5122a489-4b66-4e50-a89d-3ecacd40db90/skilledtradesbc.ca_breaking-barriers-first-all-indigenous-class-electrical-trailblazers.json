The event embraced the beautiful tapestry of Indigenous culture and traditions with blessings from the Elders, songs, and a blanketing ceremony to symbolize the apprentices\u2019 achievements, contributions to their communities, and protection for the next step in their journey.\n\nMany of these students are the first in their families to pursue a post-secondary education. They had to overcome various challenges to reach the last stage of their studies, including a global pandemic and the devastating discovery of Indigenous mass burials. \u201cDespite these obstacles, they have defied the odds, reaching a significant milestone for themselves, their families, our community and for the country,\u201d expressed Lynn White, CEO at ACCESS. Their accomplishments showcase the strength of perseverance and the capacity to overcome adversity, while carving their own path. \n\nAll twelve apprentices were supported by a tailored pathway led by[ ACCESS](https://www.accessfutures.com/) in partnership with [SkillPlan](https://skillplan.ca/) and the [Electrical Joint Training Committee (EJTC).](https://www.ejtc.org/)\n\nACCESS is an Indigenous training provider, dedicated to supporting urban Indigenous people in overcoming employment barriers and finding rewarding career opportunities. ACCESS has been there since the beginning of the journey, guiding apprentices into the electrical trades and delivering wraparound supports and resources to help them succeed. Over the years, ACCESS has supported more than 700 Indigenous apprentices to build meaningful careers in just the skilled trades industry alone.\n\nElectrical trades are often regarded as one of the more academically challenging trades training programs. SkillPlan paved the way for students who didn\u2019t meet the program\u2019s traditional prerequisites, offering essential skills training, refresher courses and tutoring. With the support of EJTC and its dedicated instructors, apprentices worked hard over the past four-plus years to complete all levels of technical training. In addition, an important partnership with the [IBEW 213](https://www.ibew213.org/) helped connect each student with employment opportunities, allowing them to gain work experience towards certification. The morning of the ceremony, each apprentice took their Interprovincial exam and now await their results to become future Red Seal Electricians. \n\n![Electrical apprentice graduates at blanketing ceremony](/sites/default/files/2023-09/ACCESS-EJTC-02-web.jpg)\n\nWith projections of more than 83,000 skilled trades jobs over the next eight years in B.C., a world of opportunity beckons for these trailblazers. They are not only poised to step into the role of skilled professionals, but also as role models and mentors to lead the next generation of apprentices. \n\n\u201cYou are not just trailblazing a career for yourself. Your cohort has trailblazed a different way of doing trades training, and that\u2019s something that has been noticed, nationally, across the country,\u201d said the Honourable Andrew Mercier, Minister of State for Workforce Development.\n\nSuccessful partnerships such as these play a pivotal role in empowering Indigenous communities and take crucial steps toward building true and meaningful reconciliation.\n\nThis past year, SkilledTradesBC has seen a 27 percent increase of Indigenous people entering trades apprenticeships across the province. We are proud to support and fund programs and initiatives to build a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable skilled trades training system and workforce that meets the needs of every single British Columbian. As a provincial crown corporation, we are grateful to have the opportunity to operate across a diverse province of 203 communities and 35 nations and we are committed to supporting and working with Indigenous peoples to establish a clear and sustainable path to lasting reconciliation.\n\nThis achievement was made possible through the partners, funders and sponsors of: \n\n  * [ACCESS](https://www.accessfutures.com/)\n\n  * [Electrical Joint Training Committee (ETJC)](https://www.ejtc.org/)\n\n  * [SkillPlan](https://skillplan.ca/)\n\n  * [IBEW 213](https://www.ibew213.org/)\n\n  * [Electrical Contractors Assocation of BC (ECABC)](https://eca.bc.ca/)\n\n  * [SkilledTradesBC](https://skilledtradesbc.ca/)\n\n  * the Government of Canada through the Canada-British Columbia Workforce Development Agreement.    \n\n\n\n\n\nAbove photo source: ACCESS Photographer: Jessie Robertson Photography    \n(_August 18, 2023 \u2013 Access Witnessing Ceremony for Electrical Apprentices.
