Chef Michael French leads a class of five students who recently completed their program last month.\n\nThe [Northern Lights College (NLC) Dawson Creek campus](https://www.nlc.bc.ca/) is one of the few schools in the province offering the Professional Cook Indigenous content apprenticeship program. Chef Michael French leads a class of five students who recently completed their first year of the program last month in May 2024. Calling themselves the Rising Bears, this cohort of talented women were the first at the college to participate in this program. To help remove any barriers and support for participation, the [North East Native Advancing Society (NENAS)](https://www.nenas.org/) provided financial assistance and wraparound supports for the students. \n\nFor over 25 years, Chef French has been an instructor for the Cook program at the Northern Lights College and is a Certified Chef de Cuisine (CCC) who has worked in restaurants all over the world. He was approached by NLC\u2019s Dean of Trades and Apprenticeships, Rod Cork, and SkilledTradesBC\u2019s Director of Truth and Reconciliation, Andrew George, to lead their inaugural Professional Cook Indigenous content program because of his background in the Indigenous community and experience teaching Indigenous cooking. \n\n![Cooking over the fire, Leslie and Malcolm](/sites/default/files/2024-06/nlc-13.JPG) _Leslie and Malcolm tending to the open fire pit at the college.

During their Level 1 year, students learned to use and honor ingredients like buffalo, elk, and rabbit, to create pemmican, bannock, and stews. \n\nRecognizing the diversity of Indigenous peoples, the course is meant to be regionally specific, and permission was asked for and granted from Elders. NLC resides on the traditional territories of the Cree, Dene, Dunne-Za, Kaska, Saulteau, Tse\u2019Khene, Tahltan, and Tlingit, and recognizes members of the Metis Nation.\n\n\u201cWe look at what\u2019s the best of all worlds and try to incorporate what we can into this program,\u201d explained Chef French, \u201cStudents are going to carry this forward and be the traditional knowledge holders of these teachings.\u201d He loves hearing that his students are excited to share what they\u2019ve learned with their families and communities. \n\n![Culinary students making chocolate embellishments and shaving white chocolate with instructor watching.](/sites/default/files/2024-06/nlc-09.jpg) _Left: Chef French with Leslie, Right: Monique shaving chocolate_\n\nFor Leslie Munch, working with food runs in her family. Her father was a baker and eventually went on to do his Level 2 apprenticeship until he passed away. Leslie\u2019s interest in cooking started when she joined her mother to cook at a camp 20 years ago. In 2017, they started their own catering business together and acquired a food trailer.\n\n\u201cI really want my career to excel, and I really want for our catering and food trailer [to excel]. This is why I\u2019m here,\u201d she emphasized. \u201cI want to learn different techniques so that I\u2019m making different foods. I want to bring more of our cultural foods to the food trailer so that everybody can enjoy it.\u201d\n\nDifferent techniques the students have gained include learning to forage and smoke with sweetgrass, a traditional Indigenous medicine, as well as how to honour where it came from. The College worked closely with local government to ensure that an open fire pit could be installed on campus so that students could learn this traditional method of cooking. \n\n![Chef and student apprentice preparing duck](/sites/default/files/2024-06/nlc-10.jpg) _Chef French with alumni student Tina_\n\nBeyond the dishes, techniques, and ingredients, there is also a cultural component. \n\n\u201cThis program is really about the traditional way of life: honoring the food, honoring the animals, honoring the spirits, everything,\u201d said student Monique Roy. \u201cAll the different things about the herbs, the berries and the medicinal uses of them.\u201d \n\nBannock is baked today using modern ingredients like baking powder, but how did they acquire this ingredient traditionally in the past?\n\n\u201cIf you take the birch, white birch, and you burn it, you can use that ash. The white ash \u2013 that\u2019s your baking powder,\u201d explained Monique. \u201cMalcolm, our resident Elder, he gave us a book that compiled of all the different herbs and how to harvest them.\u201d\n\nNLC has an established Indigenous Education department, which ensures that students have access to local elders. Malcolm Supernault is the lead Elders for this cohort and brings his unique perspective and teachings to the class.\n\n![Students showing off a dish of food they created.](/sites/default/files/2024-06/nlc-12.JPG) _Leslie, Malcolm, and Carol_\n\n\u201cIt's been great as the students seem to be very open to learning,\u201d mentioned Malcolm, \u201cand my way of teaching is that I'm here to teach you, but I'm here to learn from you as well.\u201d He speaks to how students have shared their experiences from their communities, and how things are done a little differently from his experience as a member of the Cree and Metis communities.\n\nAs an Elder for the class, he visits the students a few times each week. One of the teachings Malcolm shared is evident in the name of their cohort \u2013 the Rising Bears, emphasizing that as part of life, bears will hibernate and sleep during the winter, but there will come a time again where they will undoubtedly rise again.\n\nOther elders, including Louise Isador (Granny Lou), Florance Johnston, Dean Dokkie, and Ken Cameron, provided guidance and teachings as well.\n\nCarol Paynter started her career in a corporate setting but ever since getting a food truck, she has been wanting to improve upon her culinary experience. Prior to starting this program, she did not expect to learn so much about herself and her Indigenous background.\n\n\u201cWe've learned so much with Elders coming in and what they taught us is to really respect ourselves and really keep going,\u201d said Carol. \u201cI didn't think I'd learn as much as I have by being in this course, and I really also love the Elders, what they've taught us with medicine and the foraging from the land and everything.\u201d\n\n![Culinary student making bannock](/sites/default/files/inline-images/nlc-01.JPG) _Brianna making bannock_\n\nBrianna Wolf signed up for the program in part due to her love for cooking and growing up cooking over a campfire in the summer. \u201cI like how Malcolm knew about the different types of wood and what to use for the taste and flavor from the wood.\u201d\n\nAlthough Level 2 of the program has not been scheduled yet, many of the students are looking forward to continuing their culinary journey. \n\n\u201cI'm excited because I also want to go on to my Level 2 and then I eventually want to get my Red Seal,\u201d said Leslie, \u201cAnd that's my biggest goal is to reach that Red Seal.\u201d\n\n![Culinary student preparing vegetables in kitchen](/sites/default/files/inline-images/nlc-11.jpg) _Anita preparing vegetables_\n\nFor Anita Lerocque, she expressed interest in having her own restaurant one day. \u201cI\u2019d like to do something and have my own garden and maybe a chicken coop so I get my own produce instead of having to go and get it from the store and save my own money. And I'd like to learn how to grow certain plants.\u201d\n\nDuring the year, the Rising Bears have soared to new heights and have taken on exciting challenges. They participated in the Fusion Face-Off Competition with all the Level 1 Professional Cook students and even hosted an Elders appreciation meal, demonstrating all that they were taught during the year and expressing their gratitude for their Elders. \n\n\u201cThis program is kind of a door opener for a lot of people and once they've taken this program it, it will give them some confidence.\u201d says Malcolm. \n\nNewfound confidence in themselves is something these students will carry on into their careers and life, no matter what path they end up choosing. \n", "links": ["https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc-corporate-reports/public-interest-disclosure-act", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc/corporate-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/employment-training-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/indigenous-youth", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades/skilledtradesbc-news-feed", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/accessibility-plan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/annual-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/apprentice-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/are-you-impacted", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/become-an-apprentice", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canada-apprentice-loans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canadian-and-military-certificate-holders", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/careers-at-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/celebrating-milestones-nlcs-inaugural-professional-cook-indigenous-cohort-concludes-first-year#main-content", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-certification-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-level-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-skilled-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/contact-us", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/disclaimer", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/employment-insurance", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/equity-in-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-accommodations", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-results", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-rewrites", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-schedule", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/experienced-workers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/find-your-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/fees-payments", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/verify-tradespersons-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/foundation-programs", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/freedom-of-information", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/general-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-about-exams/exam-study-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-skilled-trades-certification/self-assessment-forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/about-exams", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/newcomers-international-tradespersons", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/govt-mandate-letter", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/grants", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/indigenous-people-in-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/labour-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/leadership-team", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/level-challengers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/new-supports-skilled-trades-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/open-data", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/personal-info-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/policies-and-bylaws", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/privacy-policy", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement/supplier-complaint-review-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/quarterly-statistical-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/request-for-review", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/service-plans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/skilledtradescertification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sponsor-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/start-an-apprenticeship", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-information-session-events", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-resources", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-trades-designation-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/strategicplan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/success-stories", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/tax-credits", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-programs-underrepresented-groups", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-providers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/truth-and-reconciliation", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/what-to-expect-on-exam-day", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/youth"]}
