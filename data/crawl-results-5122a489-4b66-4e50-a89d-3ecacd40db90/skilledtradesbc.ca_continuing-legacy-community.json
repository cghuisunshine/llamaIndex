He got his skilled trades start after a conversation with his uncle, the late Chief Leonard George of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation, which provided him with the opportunities to learn a trade and advance his career, while contributing to the economic development of his community. \n\n[Watch Curtis talk about his skilled trades journey (from 0:26 \u2013 11:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kv06bRVcfA)\n\nYears later, as a Red Seal Plumber and business owner, Curtis won the BC Achievement Foundation\u2019s Indigenous Business Award in 2022. For Curtis, Warrior Plumbing is how he gives back to the communities that have supported him and facilitated his growth. He prioritizes hiring Indigenous staff and apprentices, especially from the communities they work in, so they\u2019re continuing to uplift generations to come. \n\n[Watch Curtis talk about the impact he wants Warrior Plumbing and skilled trades to have on communities \u2013 BC Achievement Foundation Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgvdvdNmqQ)\n\nIn our interview, he reflected,\n\n> \"He [late uncle Chief Leonard George] said, \u2018Hey, Curtis, I've heard you're doing well. I've heard you've completed a couple of years of your apprenticeship and very proud of you. And I want you to know that this is what it's all about\u2026it is giving opportunities to our people\u2026 And one day, you know, you're going to have your own company and you're going to be running these projects over here.\u2019   \n>   \n> \u2026And now I'm in a position today where we are trying to recruit and train and mentor my younger family, my cousins, the youth from the Tsleil-Waututh Nation here in our community\u2026 For me, and I say this highly, to be able to be a role model for them and to really, you know, do my part in planting that seed, in their heads, in their minds, that they too can be a journeyperson plumber.\" \n\n  \n_(this has been condensed for brevity, watch the video above or at_[ _this link_](https://youtu.be/q_2Jq8EvkLE) _for the full quote)_\n\n  \nCurtis is dedicated to mentoring and creating career pathways for his apprentices, staff and community so that they can continue the legacy of his uncle and others that helped support his own career evolution. \n\n_Photo attribution -_[_BC Achievement Indigenous Business Award Recipient 2022 Warrior Plumbing_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgvdvdNmqQ) __  \n\n\n**Employers are crucial to the development and success of apprentices in industry \u2013 want to learn more about becoming a Sponsor Employer?
