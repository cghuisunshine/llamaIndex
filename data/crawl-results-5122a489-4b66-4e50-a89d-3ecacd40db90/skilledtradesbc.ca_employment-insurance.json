This support includes Employment Insurance (EI) benefits, which are typically income replacement, through [Service Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/apprentices/ei-apprentices.html). It also includes support for basic living expenses, dependent care, daily commuting and more. \n\nFor more information on financial support through the EPBC, please contact WorkBC Apprentice Services at 1-844-428-4730. \n\nImportant Notes \n\nInformation provided here only applies to an EI Client who is a SkilledTradesBC-registered apprentice and is applying for EPBC Apprentice Program Financial Supports online through [WorkBC Apprentice Services](https://workbcapprenticeservices.ca/) in order to attend the classroom portion of their apprentice training and has: \n\n  * an employer sponsor, or \n\n  * a union hiring hall sponsor, or, \n\n  * an Indigenous Skills and Employment Training Strategy (ISETS) SkilledTradesBC-approved sponsor, or is \n\n  * a pre-existing SkilledTradesBC-registered apprentice who: \n\n    * is unemployed and is attached to their employer sponsor but does not have a specific return to work date at the time of requesting financial supports to attend technical training, or \n\n    * is unemployed and without an employer sponsor, but has an active SkilledTradesBC apprentice registration at the time of requesting financial supports to attend technical training. (Note: SkilledTradesBC keeps the apprentice registration active for 18 months from the date the apprentice loses his/her employer sponsor). \n\n\n\n\nIf you do not meet the above-mentioned criteria, please contact [WorkBC Apprentice Services](https://workbcapprenticeservices.ca/) at 1-844-428-4730. You must make an appointment with a representative a minimum of four weeks prior to the start of your course in order to determine if you qualify for EPBC Apprentice Program Financial Supports. You will not be able to apply once you begin your course. \n\nYou must apply separately for EI benefits as soon as you stop working or in the last week of work or you will not be eligible for EPBC Apprentice Program Financial Supports. \n\nHow to Apply \n\n  1. You must apply for WorkBC Apprentice Services to be eligible for EI during your apprentice classroom training. To avoid delays, apply early. You can apply for apprentice services up to 4 weeks before your training starts. \n\n  2. If you have registered for a BCeID in the past, visit the [BCeID website](https://www.bceid.ca/) and click Login. Then, click Forgot your user ID or password. If you have not registered for a BCeID, visit the [BCeID website](https://www.bceid.ca/) and click on Register for a Basic BCeID. \n\n  3. You will be sent an email within 2-3 days of your application. Once you have completed and submitted your WorkBC Apprentice Application, log onto [Online Employment Services](https://apply.workbc.ca/) to get your code. It should take 1-2 business days. \n\n  4. You can now apply for EI through Service Canada. You must apply as soon as you stop working or in your last week of work (even if you don\u2019t have your Record of Employment). Application can be submitted [online](http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/ei/application/employmentinsurance.shtml) or in person at your local Service Canada office. \n\n\n\n\nContact Information and Resources \n\n  * Any questions regarding EI benefits should be directed to [Service Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/apprentices/ei-apprentices.html). \n\n  *
