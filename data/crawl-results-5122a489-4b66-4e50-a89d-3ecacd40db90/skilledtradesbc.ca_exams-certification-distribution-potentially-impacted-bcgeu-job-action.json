Affected candidates will be contacted directly to reschedule once exam services resume normal operations.\n\n  * New exam bookings are currently on hold.\n\n  * Processing times for receiving exam results may take longer than usual.\n\n\n\n\nCertification Printing and Distribution \n\n  * Recently certified journeypersons will not receive printed certificates until the strike concludes. \n\n  * Journeypersons with certificates issued in B.C. after January 28, 2009 can view their certificate numbers through their Portal account. \n\n  * Anyone who needs to verify a certification can use the [online verification tool](/forms-registration/verify-tradespersons-certification).\n\n  * Individuals who require proof of certification urgently for employment or exceptional circumstances can contact Customer Service. Urgent requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\n\n\nWe are monitoring the situation as it develops and will provide further updates on November exams should the job action continue into mid-October. \n\nApprenticeship Registration \n\n  * Apprenticeship registration packages are being held and mailed as soon as Canada Post resumes their services. In the meantime, apprentices and sponsors can find a confirmation of registration through their Portal accounts and emails. \n\n\n\n\nWe recognize the inconvenience and disruption to apprentices and trade workers and appreciate your patience and understanding. We remain committed to supporting affected individuals and resuming full services as soon as circumstances allow. \n\nIf you have any questions, please contact [Customer Service](/contact-us) for assistance. \n\nFAQs\n\n**Q: I recently submitted an exam request. Will that request be processed?**\n\nA: No, exam bookings remain suspended until the strike ends. We will contact you directly to schedule your exam once normal operations resume after the strike ends.\n\n**Q: I was advised by my school that my blended Standard Level Exam has been waived. How will that affect my mark?**\n\nA: We will use your in-class technical training result as the final mark for that level. \n\n**Q: My class wrote the blended Standard Level Exam before October 7. Will it be waived?**\n\nA: No, exams written prior to October 7 will not be waived. Your exam will be marked and blended with your in-class technical training result as normal.\n\n**Q: I have an exam scheduled at a Service BC office. Can I still write?**\n\nA: All exams at Service BC offices scheduled between October 7 to 31 have been cancelled.

There will be no rescheduling fee.\n\n**Q: My exam materials arrived at the Service BC office before October 7. Can I still book my exam?**\n\nA: Service BC is not scheduling exams during the strike. You will be contacted directly to schedule once normal operations resume after the strike ends.\n\n**Q: I am a Trade Qualifier with a challenge application expiring in October.
