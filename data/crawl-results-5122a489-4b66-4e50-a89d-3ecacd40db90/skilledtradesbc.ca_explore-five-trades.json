They handle materials and equipment and perform demolition, excavation and compaction activities. They may also perform site safety and security checks. \n\nCCWs perform a variety of work depending on the job site and scheduled work and are called upon to support in many different kinds of construction activities. Their skills and contributions are highly valued and CCWs can find a huge diversity of work sites if they wish \u2013 as they are needed on projects such as large infrastructure projects to moderate residential builds. And as this is a Red Seal trade, a qualified CCW could find work anywhere across Canada. \n\nTraining Requirements: 8 weeks over 2 years + 4000 work hours\n\n**Piledriver and Bridgeworker**\n\n![Piledriver](/sites/default/files/2024-05/20240425%20PPM%20Prince%20Rupert-39.jpg)\n\n[Piledrivers and Bridgeworkers](https://skilledtradesbc.ca/piledriver-bridgeworker) are collaborative and versatile builders involved in the creation, repair and removal of the many marine structures that make waterways efficient and safe to use. This unique and niche trade offers experience in a variety of marine-based work including the construction/installation/repair/removal of deep piles and caisson foundations and other installations such as bridges, docks, wharves, tunnels and bulkheads. \n\nPiles are the wood or concrete support structures that are integral to the construction of large projects such as bridges, piers and building foundations.

This trade is physical in nature that is also artistic and technical. \n\nBricklayers are a critical member of construction teams and work collaboratively with other teams and tradespeople. They are masters of brick installation and must know how to read and translate blueprints, prepare their tools and materials, construct and install masonry, restore and repair existing masonry and be able to troubleshoot and problem solve quickly and safely. \n\nBricklayers don\u2019t just build walls \u2013 they create other structures from brick such as arches, fireplaces, chimneys, furnaces, kilns and masonry systems. They also use materials outside of traditional brick such as natural stone, manufactured stone, tiles, glass blocks, concrete blocks, precast masonry panels, and lightweight insulated panels. \n\nTraining Requirements: 18 weeks over 3 years + 4860 work hours\n\n_Image notes: A brick project at the Trowel Trades Training Association (TTTA), photo courtesy of TTTA.  _\n\n**Saw Filer**\n\n![Saw Filer](/sites/default/files/2024-05/SawFiler_TRU.jpeg)\n\n[Saw Filers](https://skilledtradesbc.ca/saw-filer) perform a unique and highly technical role in the maintenance of high capacity saws in industrial settings \u2013 predominantly in the lumber manufacturing industry. Saw Filers must know how to maintain all types of saws which makes them indispensable in numerous industries. These saws include circular saws, band saws, gang saws, chain saws and the calibration of machinery that utilizes saws. These tradespeople must also understand the operation, maintenance and repair of saw sharpening equipment. This trade is also technically demanding with precision measuring and calibration being key to ensuring a properly maintained saw.\n\nSafety is critical to this trade \u2013 both as a Saw Filer and responsibility to those operating these complex industrial saws in workplaces. \n\nTraining Requirements:10 weeks over 2 years + 4200 work hours\n\n_Image notes:_\n\n_This is a 9 foot cut-off saw that is still used to cut large logs to length.

Concrete Finishers are tasked to use their knowledge and skills to expertly install, shape, and repair concrete. This also includes shaping concrete as an expression of design as well as function. \n\nConcrete Finishers are a part of a team that prepares different aspects of concrete installation \u2013 this includes preparing the surface, preparing the right kind of concrete, pouring and then the finishing of concrete while wet and then once set. While this role is very physical, Concrete Finishers must have a good eye for detail and timing \u2013 once the concrete is cured, fixing it is very difficult. \n\nConcrete Finisher is also a Red Seal trade \u2013 which means their standards of qualifications will be recognized across Canada.\n\nTraining Requirements: 12 weeks over 2 years + 3240 work hours\n\n[ Explore these trades and more on our Find Your Trade page](https://skilledtradesbc.ca/find-your-trade)\n", "links": ["https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc-corporate-reports/public-interest-disclosure-act", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc/corporate-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/employment-training-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/indigenous-youth", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades/skilledtradesbc-news-feed", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/accessibility-plan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/annual-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/apprentice-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/are-you-impacted", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/become-an-apprentice", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/bricklayer", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canada-apprentice-loans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canadian-and-military-certificate-holders", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/careers-at-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-certification-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-level-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-skilled-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/concrete-finisher", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/construction-craft-worker-labourer", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/contact-us", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/disclaimer", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/employment-insurance", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/equity-in-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-accommodations", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-results", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-rewrites", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-schedule", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/experienced-workers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/explore-five-trades#main-content", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/find-your-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/fees-payments", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/verify-tradespersons-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/foundation-programs", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/freedom-of-information", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/general-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-about-exams/exam-study-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-skilled-trades-certification/self-assessment-forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/about-exams", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/newcomers-international-tradespersons", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/govt-mandate-letter", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/grants", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/indigenous-people-in-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/labour-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/leadership-team", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/level-challengers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/new-supports-skilled-trades-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/open-data", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/personal-info-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/piledriver-bridgeworker", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/policies-and-bylaws", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/privacy-policy", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement/supplier-complaint-review-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/quarterly-statistical-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/request-for-review", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/saw-filer", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/service-plans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/skilledtradescertification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sponsor-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/start-an-apprenticeship", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-information-session-events", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-resources", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-trades-designation-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/strategicplan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/success-stories", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/tax-credits", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-programs-underrepresented-groups", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-providers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/truth-and-reconciliation", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/what-to-expect-on-exam-day", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/youth"]}
