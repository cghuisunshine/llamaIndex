SkilledTradesBC was given the opportunity to not only attend the event but exclusive backstage access to watch the students cook live in the kitchens.\n\nStudents from the [Professional Cook Level 1 program](/professional-cook-1) and NLC\u2019s first [Professional Cook Indigenous Content](https://www.nlc.bc.ca/programs/professional-cook-indigenous-content-direct-entry/) cohort from the [Dawson Creek campus](https://www.nlc.bc.ca/campus/dawson-creek/) were split into Red and Blue teams. The diversity of all the students\u2019 cultural backgrounds and techniques were truly demonstrated in the dishes created by the teams. This created a thrilling culinary showdown, displaying all the skills, tips and techniques. these students have learned in the last seven months.\n\n![sign on screen that says fusion faceoff](/sites/default/files/2024-04/fusion-faceoff-01.jpg)\n\nMentored by instructors Chef Regan King and Chef Michael French, the two captains were determined by the top 2 individuals who competed in a mini challenge series on the first day of competition. Team Captains then collaborated with their teams to game plan and create a three-course menu. The next day, the teams had the Dawson Co-op grocery store completely to themselves as they shopped for all their ingredients. \n\nOn the day of competition, there was a mixture of nervousness but lots of excitement in the air. Students, faculty, staff, Dawson Co-op representatives, and judges filled the kitchen and competition areas. The competition was also [livestreamed on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsHSZa6ZCvQ&ab_channel=NorthernLightsCollege), giving the opportunity for the students\u2019 families living abroad the ability to watch the event virtually. \n\n![chef in blue hat smiling](/sites/default/files/2024-04/fusion-faceoff-04.jpg)\n\nThings got on their way when the timer started and competitors had one hour to prepare, cook, and plate each course. It was impressive to see the students demonstrate care and focus on the details of their dish. Captains Sarah and Jacob were strong leaders - giving clear instructions while encouraging their teammates. \n\nAfter each course was prepared, the teams presented their dishes to the judging panel: Krista Nguyen-Forshner, Judy Kucharuk, Rod Cork and Dale McKay. The closeness amongst teammates was clear, as they patted each other on the back and smiling while the judges delivered their comments and suggestions. Throughout the competition, the judges were impressed by the caliber of their dishes, even requesting if their sauce creations could be sold by the bottle. \n\n![two dishes of food side by side](/sites/default/files/2024-04/fusion-faceoff-05.jpg)\n\nThe fusion nature of the competition shone through in all their dishes. For their main course, the Blue team prepared salmon two ways accompanied by a deep-fried bannock stuffed with dill potatoes, demonstrating creativity and traditional Indigenous food with a twist. For their dessert course, the Red team prepared a deconstructed cheesecake using foraged berries and a chocolate garnish shaped into a feather design. \n\n![two chefs in red hat making pastries](/sites/default/files/2024-04/fusion-faceoff-03.jpg)\n\nAt the end of the competition day, the judges and hosts provided their final remarks before ending the day\u2019s activities. The Red team was announced as the winner at the next evening\u2019s gala event where the teams had prepared a five-course menu. Congratulations to both teams on their hard work and a successful event!\n\n[ Learn more about the Professional Cook program](/professional-cook-1)\n", "links": ["https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc-corporate-reports/public-interest-disclosure-act", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc/corporate-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/employment-training-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/indigenous-youth", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades/skilledtradesbc-news-feed", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/accessibility-plan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/annual-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/apprentice-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/are-you-impacted", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/become-an-apprentice", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canada-apprentice-loans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canadian-and-military-certificate-holders", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/careers-at-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-certification-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-level-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-skilled-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/contact-us", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/disclaimer", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/employment-insurance", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/equity-in-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-accommodations", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-results", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-rewrites", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-schedule", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/experienced-workers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/find-your-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/fees-payments", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/verify-tradespersons-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/foundation-programs", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/freedom-of-information", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/fusion-faceoff-2024#main-content", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/general-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-about-exams/exam-study-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-skilled-trades-certification/self-assessment-forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/about-exams", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/newcomers-international-tradespersons", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/govt-mandate-letter", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/grants", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/indigenous-people-in-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/labour-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/leadership-team", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/level-challengers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/new-supports-skilled-trades-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/open-data", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/personal-info-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/policies-and-bylaws", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/privacy-policy", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement/supplier-complaint-review-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/professional-cook-1", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/quarterly-statistical-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/request-for-review", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/service-plans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/skilledtradescertification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sponsor-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/start-an-apprenticeship", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-information-session-events", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-resources", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-trades-designation-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/strategicplan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/success-stories", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/tax-credits", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-programs-underrepresented-groups", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-providers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/truth-and-reconciliation", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/what-to-expect-on-exam-day", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/youth"]}
