Over the last few months, two classes of students (30 students across two different schools) have been diligently building a small fleet of mini houses and sheds, destined for use in a variety of settings around the Lower Mainland.\n\nThe District held a morning celebration at Frank Hurt Secondary School and a lunch celebration at Guildford Park Secondary School, where students showcased their work. SkilledTradesBC staff attended alongside parents, community members, new tiny home/shed owners, and local employers.\n\n![Group of people all sitting on rows of tables outside under an event tent.

Students were split into different teams to work on each structure, under the watchful eye of instructor Owen Scharf (Guildford Park Secondary instructor, Marc Andres oversees the Frank Hurt Secondary program).\n\nFor students, the sense of accomplishment is immeasurable. From walking onto an empty lot at the beginning of the semester to seeing their structures completed and ready to be trucked off in June is a tremendous accomplishment and they have all learned so much about carpentry and themselves. \n\nWe spoke to a student who reflected on their experience and their biggest challenge and highlight:\n\n_\u201cIt was really fun\u2026 Of course, there were challenges along the way, but our group managed to work through it. It was fun regardless, because you can't really learn without going through some hardships.\u201d_\n\nLike many of the students, this was the first time they had built something from beginning to end, from standing up walls to installing windows. They were proud of their achievement and were excited to share that they were keen on completing their work-based hours and looking forward to starting their Level 2 apprenticeship.\n\n[![Tiny house with blue shingles and three sets of double doors.

In a provided comment Owen and Craig shared, \u201cThe students are more confident, able to work through their tasks and problem solve more efficiently. They become much more competent with tools and equipment, while becoming aware of job site dynamics including their roles within. They become self-reliant, start to take initiative, and some even start to take on leadership roles.\u201d  \n\n\nPrograms like these allow students to develop a variety of skills that will really help them in the workplace such as attendance, communication, teamwork and time management. Staff also remarked on the sense of pride and ownership that the students had. \u201cMost students are constantly taking pictures of their buildings. Showing the progression along the way to finished product. The pride that they show for completing the job. Students were willing to put in extra time to finish their tasks. A few times they had to be prodded to put down the tools and clean up for the day.\u201d  \n\n\nIt was easy to see this sense of pride at the celebration with students excitedly showing their parents, peers and community members the structures they had built and pointing out different details and design aspects that they had a hand in building. The various organizations and companies represented at the event was reflective of how much community effort it takes to make this program successful. Everyone had a shared goal of ensuring these students, hopeful apprentices, have a positive experience in skilled trades training and are encouraged to continue their apprenticeship to certification.\n\n[ Learn More about Youth Trades Programs](/youth)\n", "links": ["https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc-corporate-reports/public-interest-disclosure-act", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc/corporate-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/employment-training-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/indigenous-youth", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades/skilledtradesbc-news-feed", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/accessibility-plan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/annual-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/apprentice-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/are-you-impacted", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/become-an-apprentice", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canada-apprentice-loans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canadian-and-military-certificate-holders", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/careers-at-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-certification-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-level-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-skilled-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/contact-us", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/disclaimer", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/employment-insurance", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/equity-in-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-accommodations", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-results", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-rewrites", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-schedule", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/experienced-workers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/find-your-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/fees-payments", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/verify-tradespersons-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/foundation-programs", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/freedom-of-information", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/general-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-about-exams/exam-study-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-skilled-trades-certification/self-assessment-forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/about-exams", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/newcomers-international-tradespersons", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/govt-mandate-letter", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/grants", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/high-school-carpentry-students-build-tiny-homes#main-content", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/indigenous-people-in-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/labour-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/leadership-team", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/level-challengers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/new-supports-skilled-trades-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/open-data", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/personal-info-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/policies-and-bylaws", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/privacy-policy", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement/supplier-complaint-review-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/quarterly-statistical-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/request-for-review", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/service-plans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/skilledtradescertification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sponsor-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/start-an-apprenticeship", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-information-session-events", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-resources", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-trades-designation-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/strategicplan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/success-stories", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/tax-credits", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-programs-underrepresented-groups", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-providers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/truth-and-reconciliation", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/what-to-expect-on-exam-day", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/youth"]}
