They are located on each trade page under the Challenge a Certification Exam section. \n\nDefinitions:\n\n**Employer Declaration of Work Experience** \\- an attestation of your work experience in the trade, completed by your current or previous employer(s).\n\n**Statutory Declaration of Work Experience** \\- an attestation of your work experience in the trade, completed by you.

By completing this form, your direct supervisor verifies the hours you worked performing the trade, declares that they have observed you perform the specific job tasks required for your trade and certifies that the information provided is accurate.\n\nEnsure that the number of declarations you submit fulfills the minimum hours and scope of work required to challenge your trade.\n\nApplicant Name\n\nEnter the legal name used on your __ application __ form. Your name on all declaration forms must match the name used on the application form. Enter your name, as well as the supervisor\u2019s name, in the footer of all subsequent pages of the declaration form. \n\nEmployment Information of Applicant\n\nEnter the business information of the organization you worked for. If the organization no longer exists, enter the information of the organization when it was still in business. Enter the dates you worked for this organization, the hours of work experience gained and your job title during this period. Ensure that the hours recorded are for hands-on trade experience. Do not include time spent performing managerial, administrative or supervisory duties, volunteer work, teaching/instructing, or attending training courses.\n\nYour total work experience is calculated by adding the number of hours declared on each Employer and/or Statutory Declaration form submitted with your application. The number of hours entered must be specific. Entries such as \u201cmore than one thousand\u201d or \u201clots\u201d will not be accepted.\n\nSupervisor Contact Information\n\nEnter the **current** contact information for your direct supervisor when you worked for this organization. SkilledTradesBC will contact this individual to verify your work experience. If your direct supervisor cannot be reached by SkilledTradesBC, your experience from this organization will not be considered for your application. \n\nSupervisor Declaration of Job Task Performance of Applicant\n\nThis section lists job tasks that a journeyperson in the trade must be able to perform. Supervisors completing this form must check \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d in the Declaration Response column to indicate whether they have personally observed the applicant perform the job tasks listed. \n\nYour completed form(s) must show that you have experience performing a minimum percentage of the job tasks required for your trade. The minimum percentage required is shown at the top of the declaration form.

Refer to the form to determine if this applies to your trade and submit the prerequisite documentation along with your application and Employer and/or Statutory Declarations. \n\n**Note:** Do not submit paperwork for training or certification earned outside of Canada as it will not be reviewed.\n\nSupervisor Signature\n\nThe direct supervisor of the applicant must personally sign and date this section. SkilledTradesBC cannot assess unsigned forms.\n\n## \n\n#  Statutory Declaration of Work Experience Form\n\nA  _Statutory Declaration of Work Experience_ form is a declaration of work experience in the trade, completed by you. This form is required when there is no direct supervisor available to attest to your work experience. This may be the case for periods when you were self-employed or if a previous supervisor is unavailable or unwilling to complete an Employer Declaration form. In all cases, Statutory Declarations must be accompanied by a minimum of three references.\n\nFor periods of employment that cannot be verified with a former supervisor, you must submit a separate Statutory Declaration form for each employer. For example, if you listed two periods of employment for which your direct supervisors could not be contacted, you would submit two Statutory Declaration forms. \n\nNote that unless your work experience was gained through self-employment, your application will not be accepted if it is only accompanied by a Statutory Declaration. If you were not self-employed, you must provide an Employer Declaration from at least one employer who can verify your work experience.\n\nApplicant Name\n\nEnter the legal name used in your application __ form. Your name on all declaration forms must match the name used on the application form. \n\nSelf-Employment or Employment Information \n\nEnter the business information of your own business, or the organization for which you worked. If the organization no longer exists, enter the information of the organization when it was still in business. Enter the dates you worked for this organization, the hours of work experience gained, and your job title during this period. Ensure that the hours recorded are for hands-on trade experience. Do not include time spent performing managerial, administrative or supervisory duties, volunteer work, teaching/instructing, or attending training courses.\n\nYour total work experience is calculated by adding the number of hours declared on each Employer and/or Statutory Declaration form submitted. The number of hours entered must be specific. Entries such as \u201cmore than one thousand\u201d or \u201clots\u201d will not be accepted.\n\nReason for Statutory Declaration\n\nYou must indicate your reason for submitting a Statutory Declaration form instead of an Employer Declaration form. Unless you were self-employed, you must also describe the steps you have taken to try to obtain an Employer Declaration form. If sufficient evidence of the steps taken is not provided, your application may not be approved.\n\nStatutory Declaration of Job Task Performance\n\nThis section lists job tasks that a journeyperson in the trade must be able to perform. Check \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d in the Declaration Response column to indicate whether you performed the job tasks listed during the period of employment indicated in Section B of this form. Your completed form(s) must show that you have experience performing a minimum percentage of the job tasks required for your trade. The minimum percentage required is shown at the top of the declaration form for each trade. Your total percentage will be determined based on the combined responses on all declaration forms submitted with your application.\n\nApplicant Signature\n\nYou must sign and date this section. SkilledTradesBC cannot assess unsigned forms.\n\nReferences\n\nA minimum of three references must accompany each Statutory Declaration form. Enter names and **current** contact information for individuals who can attest to your self-declared work experience for the period of employment that you have indicated in Section B of this form. References listed must be related to the organization and period of employment listed in Section B of the form. This may include suppliers, former employees, contractors, or regular, long-term clients. SkilledTradesBC will contact each reference to verify your work experience. \n\nNote that SkilledTradesBC must be able to verify not only the hours you have worked, but also the job tasks you have performed. If your work experience cannot be verified with the references provided, your application will not be approved.\n\n[ Questions?
