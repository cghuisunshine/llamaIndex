They read and interpret drawings and specifications to determine insulation requirements, select the amount and type of insulation to be installed, and measure and cut insulating materials to the required dimensions. They then apply, install, repair and maintain insulating materials to mechanical systems, such as piping, tanks, vessels, and HVAC systems. Insulators (Heat and Frost) also lay out and fabricate components on-site, or remove and/or encapsulate old insulation. Removing materials such as asbestos, ceramic fibres and lead is also part of the trade. They also spray insulating materials and install fireproofing and fire stop systems. Insulators work in commercial and industrial settings, such as gas plants, refineries, hospitals, schools, and convention centres.
