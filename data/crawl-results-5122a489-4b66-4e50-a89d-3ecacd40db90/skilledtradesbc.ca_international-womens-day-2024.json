The movement began with protests and campaigning for change to women\u2019s oppression, inequality, suffrage, and working conditions. In 1910 the International Conference of Working Women formalized International Women\u2019s Day and the date of March 8 was officially designated in 1917.\n\nSince then the day has been celebrated and used as an engagement point to continue to drive awareness and change for women\u2019s rights and issues. It is also a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women.\n\nThis theme is particularly significant for SkilledTradesBC as investing in the progress of women in skilled trades is an organizational priority. Our Trades, Access, and Inclusion department work with organizations to facilitate key initiatives such as Discover and sampler programs and supporting BCCWITT's [Leaders in Trades program](https://bccwitt.ca/leaders-in-trades-program/). By investing in women, we can accelerate progress across several fronts including building more welcoming and inclusive workplaces, empowering more people in sustainable and rewarding careers, and helping build the labour force that builds B.C.'s communities. It is an investment that benefits everyone today, tomorrow, and for future generations. \n\nWe also continue to evolve the way we mark progress for women in trades - we are looking beyond registration numbers and have begun tracking environment. Our goal metric 3C tracks \u2018Women in Underrepresented Trades Training Environments are Free of Racism and Discrimination (Technical Training and On-the-Job Training)\u2019 was added as part of our new [Strategic Plan](/strategicplan). This performance measure will be important to help us to understand the complexities and challenges of retaining women in apprenticeships and progressing in their skilled trades career. \n\n  \nINTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY CONTEST\n\n[![tag a superwoman contest graphic](/sites/default/files/inline-images/IWD_Tag%20A%20Superwoman%20Contest_2024.png)](https://www.instagram.com/p/C4Qs20NMLD_/)\n\nSkilledTradesBC has partnered with the [BC Centre For Women in the Trades](https://bccwitt.ca/), [Kitselas Five Tier System](https://k5t.ca/) and [Build TogetHER BC ](https://www.buildtogetherbc.ca/)for an exciting Instagram contest running from March 8 until March 25.

Having a trade means I've never worried about job security or felt tied to a single employer. I can move anywhere in the world even if I don't speak the language and know I'll always find work. I carry my trade in my hands and in my expertise and no one can take that from me, that's a very empowering feeling! \"\n\n  * Breena Jackson, Cabinetmaker\n\n\n\n\n\"The skilled trades have many amazing opportunities to fulfilling and well paying careers. Women and other equity deserving groups deserve the chance to work in the skilled trades and to thrive in them.\"\n\n  * Nicole Wiet, Elevator Mechanic\n\n\n\n\n[ CLICK HERE FOR MORE WOMEN IN TRADES STORIES](/success-stories)\n", "links": ["https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc-corporate-reports/public-interest-disclosure-act", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc/corporate-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/employment-training-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/indigenous-youth", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades/skilledtradesbc-news-feed", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/accessibility-plan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/annual-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/apprentice-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/are-you-impacted", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/become-an-apprentice", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canada-apprentice-loans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canadian-and-military-certificate-holders", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/careers-at-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-certification-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-level-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-skilled-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/contact-us", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/disclaimer", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/employment-insurance", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/equity-in-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-accommodations", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-results", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-rewrites", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-schedule", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/experienced-workers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/find-your-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/fees-payments", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/verify-tradespersons-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/foundation-programs", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/freedom-of-information", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/general-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-about-exams/exam-study-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-skilled-trades-certification/self-assessment-forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/about-exams", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/newcomers-international-tradespersons", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/govt-mandate-letter", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/grants", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/indigenous-people-in-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/international-womens-day-2024#main-content", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/labour-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/leadership-team", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/level-challengers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/new-supports-skilled-trades-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/open-data", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/personal-info-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/policies-and-bylaws", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/privacy-policy", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement/supplier-complaint-review-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/qa-red-seal-motorcycle-technician-amanda-koehler", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/quarterly-statistical-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/request-for-review", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/service-plans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/skilledtradescertification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sponsor-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/start-an-apprenticeship", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-information-session-events", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-resources", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-trades-designation-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/strategicplan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/success-stories", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/success-story-amandeep-beesla", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/success-story-amy-carr", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/success-story-monique-song", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/tax-credits", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-programs-underrepresented-groups", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-providers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/truth-and-reconciliation", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/what-to-expect-on-exam-day", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/youth"]}
