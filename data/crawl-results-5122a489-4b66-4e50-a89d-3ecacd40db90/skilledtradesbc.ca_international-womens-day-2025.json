International Women\u2019s Day has been celebrated globally for over 100 years. The movement began with protests and campaigning for change to women\u2019s oppression, inequality, suffrage, and working conditions. In 1910 the International Conference of Working Women formalized International Women\u2019s Day and the date of March 8 was officially designated in 1917.\n\nSince then the day has been celebrated and used as an engagement point to continue to drive awareness and change for women\u2019s rights and issues. It is also a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women.\n\nThis year\u2019s theme highlights the importance of amplifying the voices of all women as well as the power of opportunities, aligning with the organizational priorities at SkilledTradesBC. We work with industry partners and organizations to facilitate [key initiatives](/training-programs-underrepresented-groups) such as trades discovery and trade sampler programs for women and equity-deserving groups. \n\nBy providing opportunities and removing barriers, we can drive progress toward building an inclusive trades community that reflects our population, supporting sustainable careers, and strengthening B.C.\u2019s workforce. \n\nInternational Women\u2019s Day may be only one day of the year, but our goal is to continue to feature stories from women who have unlocked opportunities and overcome barriers to find success in a fulfilling skilled trades career all year round.

Having a trade means I've never worried about job security or felt tied to a single employer. I can move anywhere in the world even if I don't speak the language and know I'll always find work. I carry my trade in my hands and in my expertise and no one can take that from me, that's a very empowering feeling! \"\n\n  * Breena Jackson, Cabinetmaker\n\n\n\n\n\"The skilled trades have many amazing opportunities to fulfilling and well paying careers. Women and other equity deserving groups deserve the chance to work in the skilled trades and to thrive in them.\"\n\n  * Nicole Wiet, Elevator Mechanic\n\n\n\n", "links": ["https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc-corporate-reports/public-interest-disclosure-act", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc/corporate-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/employment-training-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/indigenous-youth", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades/skilledtradesbc-news-feed", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/accessibility-plan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/annual-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/apprentice-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/are-you-impacted", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/become-an-apprentice", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canada-apprentice-loans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canadian-and-military-certificate-holders", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/careers-at-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-certification-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-level-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-skilled-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/contact-us", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/disclaimer", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/employment-insurance", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/equity-in-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-accommodations", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-results", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-rewrites", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-schedule", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/experienced-workers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/find-your-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/fees-payments", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/verify-tradespersons-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/foundation-programs", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/freedom-of-information", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/general-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-about-exams/exam-study-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-skilled-trades-certification/self-assessment-forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/about-exams", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/newcomers-international-tradespersons", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/govt-mandate-letter", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/grants", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/indigenous-people-in-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/international-womens-day-2025#main-content", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/labour-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/leadership-team", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/level-challengers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/new-supports-skilled-trades-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/open-data", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/personal-info-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/policies-and-bylaws", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/privacy-policy", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement/supplier-complaint-review-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/quarterly-statistical-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/request-for-review", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/service-plans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/skilledtradescertification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sponsor-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/start-an-apprenticeship", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-information-session-events", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-resources", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-trades-designation-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/strategicplan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/success-stories", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/tax-credits", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-programs-underrepresented-groups", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-providers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/truth-and-reconciliation", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/what-to-expect-on-exam-day", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/youth"]}
