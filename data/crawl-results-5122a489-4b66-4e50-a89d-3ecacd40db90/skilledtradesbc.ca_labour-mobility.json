You will not have to re-certify or get a re-issued certificate. \n\nFor certain trades, you will need to contact the local safety authority as they have additional licenses and requirements to work within B.C. \n\nMutual Recognition of Qualifications \n\nSkilledTradesBC recognizes certificates issued by jurisdictional authorities in other Canadian provinces or territories. These authorities also recognize B.C. certificates. Recognition applies to individuals who are certified and in good standing in their trade with the appropriate provincial or territorial authority. These individuals have the same rights and obligations to practice the same occupation in all Canadian provinces and territories without significant additional training, experience, examinations or assessment of qualifications and without meeting a residency requirement. \n\nRules for Mutual Recognition \n\n  * Mutual recognition only applies if you have your full certification or license. \n\n  * Trades/occupations must be the same or very similar in both jurisdictions. \n\n  * You must meet provincial or territorial Occupational Health and Safety requirements for your trade, which may require you to complete short courses or minor training specific to the jurisdiction. \n\n  * Regulated trades such as Electrician, Crane Operator, Security Alarm Installer, funeral trades and others may also require special licenses. (See Regulated Trades sections below.) \n\n\n\n\n## \n\nTrades Available in Other Jurisdictions\n\nThe following is a list of trades that are not offered in British Columbia but are available in the nearby provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. This list is part of British Columbia\u2019s commitment to the New West Partnership agreement to support greater mobility for apprentices.

It\u2019s a good idea to check and compare the B.C. trade name with that of the issuing jurisdiction (if you\u2019re coming to work in B.C. from elsewhere) or destination jurisdiction (if you\u2019re going to work in another Canadian jurisdiction). \n\nRegulated Trades in other Provinces and Territories \n\nRestrictions on the practice of trades occupations vary by province and territory, so it\u2019s best to contact the relevant jurisdictional authority to determine their requirements. \n\nRegulated Trades in B.C. \n\nThere are two types of skilled trades in B.C.: regulated and non-regulated trades. A number of trades are regulated in B.C. for consumer protection and to ensure public health and safety. This means to perform work in these occupations you must be a registered apprentice with SkilledTradesBC or hold a certificate of qualification, and/or be licensed by the regulatory body for that trade. Although SkilledTradesBC sets standards and grants certificates for the skilled trades, there are other regulatory bodies in B.C. that control licensing and determine who can legally work in the trade. \n\nExamples of regulated trades in B.C. include, but are not limited to: \n\nTrade | Regulatory Body  \n---|---  \nAuto Glass | [ICBC](http://www.icbc.com/)  \nBoilermaker   \nElectrician   \nGasfitter   \nPlumber | [Technical Safety BC](https://www.technicalsafetybc.ca/)  \nCrane Operator | [WorkSafe BC](https://www.worksafebc.com/en)  \nFuneral Director | [Embalmer Business Practices -
