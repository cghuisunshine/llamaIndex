See the application process below.\n\nHow To Assess Your Level\n\nFirst, determine your level based on the work-based training hours you have completed. The required hours for each level are the same for all trades under Skilled Trades Certification.\n\n  * Level 1: 1,800 hours (approx. 1 year)\n\n  * Level 2: 3,600 hours (approx. 2-3 years)\n\n  * Level 3: 5,400 hours (approx. 3-5 years)\n\n\n\n\nNext, fill out the [self-assessment form](/get-certified-skilled-trades-certification/self-assessment-forms)* for your trade. These forms allow you to assess your knowledge of each of the areas of competencies taught in the particular level of technical training. The questions are also weighted similarly to the exam written at the end of each technical training level.\n\nYour results will highlight areas of strength and areas where you may need further knowledge or practical experience.\n\n  * If you score 65% or above, you may be ready for the selected level exam.\n\n  * If you score 64% or below, you should seek further training or support, or re-take the self-assessment at a lower level.\n\n\n\n\n* Challenging the level exam for [Powerline Technician](/powerline-technician) is not available. Powerline Technician workers will need to either register as an apprentice and work towards certification or [challenge the certification exam](/experienced-workers-stc-trades) to become certified. \n\n![](/sites/default/files/2022-12/apply%20to%20be%20a%20designated%20training%20provider.jpg)\n\n## \n\nSteps to Challenge a Level Exam for Skilled Trades Certification trades\n\nThe following steps only apply for those challenging a designated Skilled Trades Certification (compulsory) trade. To challenge a level exam for other trades, visit the [Challenge a Level Exam page](/challenge-level-exam). \n\nCheck your eligibility\n\nTo start, you will need to meet the following minimum work-based training hour requirements to be eligible to challenge each level exam:\n\n  * Level 1: 1,800 hours (approximately 1 year)\n\n  * Level 2*: 3,600 hours (approximately 2-3 years)\n\n  * Level 3*: 5,400 hours (approximately 3-5 years)\n\n\n\n\n*You must pass each level exam in sequence to ensure you have the foundational knowledge needed for advanced training.\n\nComplete a self-assessment\n\nComplete the [self-assessment](/get-certified-skilled-trades-certification/self-assessment-forms) for your trade and level based on your work-based training hours to assess your knowledge of each of the areas of competencies taught in technical training. You can challenge higher levels directly if you meet the minimum required work-based training hour requirements and pass the self-assessment form for that level.\n\nYour results will highlight areas of strength and where you may need further knowledge or practical experience.\n\n  * If you score 65 per cent or above, you may be ready for the selected level exam.\n\n  * If you score 64 per cent or below, you should seek further training or support, or re-take the self-assessment at a lower level.\n\n\n\n\nDownload and save a PDF copy of your results.\n\nRegister as an apprentice\n\nBefore submitting your application, you must first register as an apprentice by [creating a SkilledTradesBC Portal account](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/Account/Login/Register).\n\nSubmit your application for verification\n\nComplete and submit the [level placement exam application form](/media/2236/download) with a copy of your self-assessment results to [customerservice@skilledtradesbc.ca](mailto:customerservice@skilledtradesbc.ca). The application form must be signed by your sponsor/employer or a certified journeyperson to endorse your level of experience and knowledge of the trade. Incomplete applications will not be processed and will be returned to you.\n\nThere is **no fee** for level exams.\n\nGet notified of your application result\n\nSkilledTradesBC will review your application to determine whether you meet the requirements to challenge the level exam. The typical processing time is approximately 10 to 15 business days.\n\nIf approved:\n\n  * SkilledTradesBC will schedule the level exam and you will receive an email notification confirming the details.\n\n  * If the exam date requested is unavailable, we will schedule you for the next available date at your chosen location. \n\n\n\n\nIf denied:\n\n  * You will receive an email notification with further instructions on next steps.\n\n\n\n\nWrite your level exam\n\nVisit the [Exam Study and Support section](/get-certified-about-exams/exam-study-support) for resources to help you succeed\n\nYou have a maximum of two attempts to achieve the required 70 per cent passing score on your level exam. For more information on exam rewrites,[ see the Exam Rewrites page](/exam-rewrites).\n\nRegister to attend in-class technical training\n\nAfter passing your level exam, your profile on the Portal will show your apprenticeship journey and reflect the level you have achieved, including credit for the relevant technical training and work-based training hours. Make sure to register as early as possible to secure a seat for technical training with a [SkilledTradesBC-designated training provider](/all-approved-training-providers-list).\n\nYour trade program may be available at a school in your community or you may have to travel to relocate for a couple of weeks each year. [Trades Training BC](https://www.tradestrainingbc.ca/) and [EducationPlannerBC](https://www.educationplannerbc.ca/) provide helpful search tools to find where your trade program is being offered across the province. \n\nWe recommend scheduling your in-class technical training once a year throughout your apprenticeship to get a balance of theory and on-the-job practical experience. It\u2019s important to communicate with your employer about the best time to be away from work for in-class technical training. \n\nYou are now on your apprenticeship journey to certification!\n\nNew\n\nSupports\n\nIn addition to provincial and federal support available to registered employers and apprentices, we have enhanced our support for Skilled Trades
