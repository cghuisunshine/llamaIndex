Adjusting from a dynamic classroom environment to a home learning setup can be difficult, but it doesn\u2019t have to be!\n\nIf your child has a natural interest in creating, building and fixing (think Legos or origami) perhaps they might be a future trades professional.\n\nSo, we\u2019ve compiled a list of free online projects you can easily do at home with your kids. These projects are fun and educational, while sparking the analytical, creative and problem-solving spirit that trades careers can offer. Let\u2019s go!\n\n1\\. Power Smart: Electro Magnet\n\n[Power Smart For Schools](https://schools.bchydro.com/) was created with B.C. teachers in mind, but there\u2019s no reason why these projects can\u2019t be done at home. There\u2019s a ton of free activities that focus on conservation, electricity, energy, safety and sustainability. What\u2019s even better is that all the activities align with the B.C. curriculum. This simple project shows kids how to create their very own electromagnet and learn how electricity can be converted to magnetism.\n\n**Difficulty:** Easy  \n**Pros:** Easy to follow along, you likely have these materials at home  \n**Cons:** None\n\n**Link:**[**https://schools.bchydro.com/activities/31**](https://schools.bchydro.com/activities/31)\n\n**Related Trades:**[Construction Electrician](/electrician-construction), [Industrial Electrician](/electrician-industrial), [Industrial Mechanic (Millwright)](/industrial-mechanic-millwright)\n\n2\\. Lowe\u2019s Home Improvement: Woodworking Projects for Kids: How to Build a Box\n\nCreate your own multi-purpose wooden box. If you don\u2019t have a home wood-working shop, you can improvise with things like construction paper, cardboard, glue and tape. Remember, the skilled trades are all about solving everyday problems using technique, accuracy, safety and process.\n\n**Difficulty:** Medium  \n**Pros:** Easy to follow along, great fundamental learning  \n**Cons:** You may need to improvise with materials\n\n**Link:**[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnuNu1cpjC4 &t=26s**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnuNu1cpjC4&t=26s)\n\n**Related Trades:**[Carpenter](/carpenter), [Cabinet Maker](/cabinetmaker), [Metal Fabricator](/metal-fabricator-fitter), [Industrial Mechanic (Millwright)](/industrial-mechanic-millwright)\n\n3\\. How to Make a DIY Electric Powered Mini Car\n\nNot only does this DIY car drive on its own, but it also teaches some basics on how electric circuits work. This one is for your intermediate learner, but well worth the time.\n\n**Difficulty:** Medium  \n**Pros:** Fun, gratifying and easy to follow along  \n**Cons:** This project requires some items which you might not have at home\n\n**Link:**[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymG8w4ZIpE &t=66s**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymG8w4ZIpE&t=66s)\n\n**Related Trades:**[Automotive Service Technician](/automotive-service-technician), [Industrial Mechanic (Millwright)](/industrial-mechanic-millwright), [Machinist](/machinist), [Construction Electrician](/electrician-construction), [Industrial Electrician](/electrician-industrial)\n\n4\\.

This rubber band helicopter project is relatively simple and uses materials you can find at home. It\u2019s fun and teaches your kids to think like a builder and problem solver.\n\n**Difficulty:** Easy  \n**Pros:** Fun, gratifying and easy to follow along  \n**Cons:** The helicopter can be flown as high as 20 feet, so a backyard may be useful!\n\n**Link:**[**https://www.stem-inventions.com/helicopters**](https://www.stem-inventions.com/helicopters)\n\n**Related Trades:**[Aircraft Maintenance Technician](/aircraft-maintenance-technician), [Aircraft Structural Technician](/aircraft-structural-technician)\n\n5\\. Truss Bridge\n\nThis Truss Bridge is also made by [Stem Inventions](https://www.stem-inventions.com/) and teaches kids how to make a bridge that can hold up to 20lbs!
