His five-person team works out of a studio workshop in East Vancouver.\n\nThe small crew has been fortunate to continue working during the COVID-19 pandemic. A large shop lets them maintain appropriate physical distancing from each other, and they have comprehensive cleaning and sanitizing procedures. They\u2019ve also limited outside contact, so there aren\u2019t any studio visits or in-house meetings. \n\nHenry completed his apprenticeship in welding with SkilledTradesBC in 2013, and he\u2019s also a self-taught designer. \n\n\u201cI got my ticket and my first job welding dumpsters before moving through the industry and working in a variety of commercial environments,\u201d says Henry. \u201cWhen I founded my own studio four years ago, my focus had changed to furniture and fine architectural work. We\u2019ve designed dozens of products, developed hundreds of proprietary finishes and textures, and expanded from metal exclusively to working with glass, resin, stone, and wood.\u201d\n\nHenry\u2019s also an employer sponsor with SkilledTradesBC and has been helping apprentices with their trades journey for many years. \n\n\u201cI became a sponsor because having accreditation is a valuable thing that people can take forwards in life,\u201d says Henry. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary for the path everyone wants to take, but having a Red Seal in any trade is an important thing if people ever end up moving or changing professions or want to move from the artisan side of manufacturing back to industrial. I value diversity of experience too, so having people learn outside the studio is important. Our people have learned things at fabrication school that we\u2019ve integrated into our own style of manufacturing.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s led to interesting and award-winning projects, including a large art commission for Ts\u2019msyen artist Phil Gray, which lives in the Telus Garden building in downtown Vancouver. New Format was charged with finding an innovative way to take a style of work traditionally executed in cedar and translate it into copper. \n\nThe fabrication team includes Harry Neilson and Colin Tapp. Harry earned his Red Seal in metal fabrication in March. Colin Tapp is a first-year metal fabrication apprentice, but he already has five years of industry experience under his toolbelt. \n\nHarry\u2019s love for vintage cars\u2014which gave him an understanding of antiquated production processes used for these cars, like soldering, sheet metal, and material preparation and finishing\u2014eventually led him to metal fabrication. \n\n\u201cI\u2019d always been interested in learning how to manipulate and control this medium,\u201d says Harry. \u201cMetal is an incredibly interesting material that can allow you to realize creations that are not possible with other materials.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s been with New Format for his entire apprenticeship; the Ts\u2019msyen art was one of the projects he worked on. \n\n\u201cHenry has taught me a lot during my apprenticeship,\u201d says Harry. \u201cHe\u2019s helped me with staying focused on the task at hand and how to manage and prioritize time. His help has also come in the way of leading by example. He\u2019s a skilled tradesperson and has an attitude and method that is conducive to success. I\u2019m proud to be one of two fabricators working for New Format Studio, which is developing an international reputation as a bespoke furniture maker.\u201d\n\nColin\u2019s start in the craft came from a high school art metal class that initially piqued his interest in welding and the possibilities of working with metals. \n\n\u201cI got into steel fabrication because I always found welding intriguing and wanted a trade that involved welding but allowed me to do more than just push welding rod all day,\u201d says Colin. \n\nHenry recognized Colin\u2019s desire to achieve more and has been teaching him techniques to elevate his work.\n\n\u201cColin has a long family history of tinkering and is a skilled generalist, so if we need a machine fixed or a tool invented, he\u2019s the guy,\u201d says Henry. \u201cWe hired him as a shop fabricator and began integrating him into other functions on the shop floor, as his broad skillset became more apparent.\u201d\n\nColin recently created a set of six patinated steel Mers side tables for Nike\u2019s new sports research lab, the LeBron James Building, in Oregon.\n\n> _\u201cHenry has provided me with an outstanding work environment, where I can look forward to coming in to every day, all while challenging my abilities as a fabricator,\u201d says Colin. \u201cI walk away at the end of each day being thankful I\u2019ve landed where I have.\u201d_\n\nHarry sees his future developing his skill in metalworking by taking up the long-lost skill of panel beating, which is the forming of steel and aluminum into a compound shape. Henry says very few people practice this\u2014it\u2019s done on vintage cars and in artistic metalwork.\n\nUntil recently, Colin had always wanted to own his own metal fabrication shop, but since working at New Format Studio, he aspires to see where he can go and what he can do for the company.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re starting out in the steel/metal fabrication trade, it\u2019s good to work with different companies, as you need to see what you like and what you don\u2019t,\u201d says Colin. \u201cThere are many different avenues in the metal trades, so try to find the one that will make you enjoy every day you work.\u201d\n", "links": ["https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc-corporate-reports/public-interest-disclosure-act", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc/corporate-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/employment-training-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/indigenous-youth", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades/skilledtradesbc-news-feed", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/accessibility-plan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/annual-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/apprentice-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/are-you-impacted", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/become-an-apprentice", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canada-apprentice-loans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canadian-and-military-certificate-holders", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/careers-at-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-certification-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-level-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-skilled-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/contact-us", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/disclaimer", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/employment-insurance", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/equity-in-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-accommodations", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-results", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-rewrites", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-schedule", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/experienced-workers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/find-your-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/fees-payments", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/verify-tradespersons-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/foundation-programs", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/freedom-of-information", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/general-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-about-exams/exam-study-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-skilled-trades-certification/self-assessment-forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/about-exams", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/newcomers-international-tradespersons", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/govt-mandate-letter", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/grants", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/indigenous-people-in-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/labour-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/leadership-team", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/level-challengers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/metal-fabricators#main-content", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/new-supports-skilled-trades-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/open-data", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/personal-info-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/policies-and-bylaws", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/privacy-policy", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement/supplier-complaint-review-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/quarterly-statistical-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/request-for-review", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/service-plans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/skilledtradescertification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sponsor-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/start-an-apprenticeship", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-information-session-events", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-resources", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-trades-designation-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/strategicplan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/success-stories", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/tax-credits", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-programs-underrepresented-groups", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-providers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/truth-and-reconciliation", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/what-to-expect-on-exam-day", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/youth"]}
