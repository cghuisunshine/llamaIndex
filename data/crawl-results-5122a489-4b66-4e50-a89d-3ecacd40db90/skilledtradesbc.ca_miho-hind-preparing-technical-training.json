We connected with her on the eve of her starting level 3 technical training to see how she is doing.\n\nIn 2024, we shared the [inspirational story of Miho Hind](/finding-community-skilled-trades-mihos-story) \u2013 a newcomer and new mom who found a supportive community in her new career as a plumbing apprentice. We connected with her on the eve of her starting level 3 technical training at Camosun College, and she was excited and nervous to take the next step in her apprenticeship journey. During our conversation, she shared two strategies that helped her prepare for the next level of training. \n\n  \n**Strategy #1 - Advance reading for level 3 technical training**\n\nReflecting on her first two technical training experiences, she wanted to be more prepared for level 3. With English being her second language, she recognized that she may need more time to read and understand the learning materials, so she got a head start on reviewing the course materials before her first day of technical training. This also gave her more time to reach out to her experienced colleagues regarding any concepts that required further clarification.\n\n  \n**Strategy #2 - Seeking accommodations**\n\nMiho learned of the range of SkilledTradesBC\u2019s [_exam accommodations_](https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-accommodations) when she inquired about bringing a translation dictionary to the exam. She recommends learning more about exam supports such as dictionaries, extra time, translators and other resources that are available to eligible exam writers to support a path to success. \n\n\"I contacted SkilledTradesBC for accommodation to see if I could bring in a translation dictionary to my level 3 exam. I heard I could get an extra hour* for my exam because English is my second language. This time I am going to ask for that, it would be a big help.\" \n\n  \nMiho has made steady but meaningful professional growth professionally and continues to be humble about her journey and apply her learnings forward. In the workplace, Miho is taking on more senior duties, such as leading newer apprentices and being a mentor to them. She also has more confidence to advocate for herself and team. Miho plans to complete her level 4 technical training next year. Best of luck, Miho!\n\n_***** For a request for extra time, SkilledTradesBC Completions staff set up an assessment to discuss the exam writer\u2019s needs. In Miho's case, this extra time request was for language dictionary support, which gives time for the exam writer to process home language to English translations. _  \n\n\n**Looking for tips on how
