In high school, she gravitated towards hands-on courses like woodworking and drafting. She loved the precision, the fine details, and the sense of accomplishment that came from creating something from scratch. With a natural talent for design, she pursued fashion, but plans changed with the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWith the world in upheaval, Morgan was seeking a new path: a job that would allow her to support herself right away. Freshly relocated to Vancouver Island, she learned about an apprenticeship opportunity in [architectural sheet metal ](/architectural-sheet-metal-worker)with Top Line Roofing Ltd. It\u2019s a field she\u2019d never considered before, but the chance to work with her hands, stay creative and start earning money right away was too good to pass up. She decided to give it a try, not knowing that it would soon become a fulfilling career path she never imagined for herself.\n\nAs Morgan began her apprenticeship, she quickly discovered that architectural sheet metal was a dynamic trade. \u201cYou really get to work with your hands. It\u2019s almost like metal origami\u2014bending and shaping metal,\u201d she explains. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain way to do things, but there\u2019s lots of room for creativity as well.\u201d\n\nMorgan explains that architectural sheet metal involves constructing entire exterior wall systems that are crucial to protecting buildings. \u201cSomething people may not realize is the amount of work that goes into a building, just the number of layers underneath a wall, that all have a system of working together.\u201d\n\nLast August, Morgan completed her technical training and passed her final exam\u2014officially becoming a certified journeyperson in her trade. She was also recognized as the 2024 Top Architectural Sheet Metal Apprentice in BC by the Roofing Contractors Association of BC (RCABC). With these achievements under her toolbelt, exciting opportunities lie ahead as she continues to build her career.\n\n![](/sites/default/files/inline-images/IMG_0884_0.jpeg)\n\nThough it may not have been her first choice, Morgan found a career that aligned with her passion for creativity and hands-on work. The trades offer more than just a paycheck, they provide endless opportunities, skill development and a rewarding future. Sometimes, the unexpected path can lead to the most fulfilling destination. \n\nAre you interested in exploring a career in the skilled trades? \n\n[ Become An Apprentice](/become-an-apprentice)\n", "links": ["https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc-corporate-reports/public-interest-disclosure-act", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc/corporate-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/employment-training-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/indigenous-youth", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades/skilledtradesbc-news-feed", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/accessibility-plan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/annual-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/apprentice-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/architectural-sheet-metal-worker", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/are-you-impacted", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/become-an-apprentice", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canada-apprentice-loans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canadian-and-military-certificate-holders", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/careers-at-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-certification-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-level-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-skilled-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/contact-us", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/disclaimer", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/employment-insurance", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/equity-in-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-accommodations", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-results", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-rewrites", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-schedule", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/experienced-workers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/find-your-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/fees-payments", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/verify-tradespersons-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/foundation-programs", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/freedom-of-information", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/general-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-about-exams/exam-study-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-skilled-trades-certification/self-assessment-forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/about-exams", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/newcomers-international-tradespersons", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/govt-mandate-letter", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/grants", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/indigenous-people-in-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/labour-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/leadership-team", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/level-challengers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/morgan-strong-fashion-future-skilled-trades#main-content", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/new-supports-skilled-trades-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/open-data", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/personal-info-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/policies-and-bylaws", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/privacy-policy", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement/supplier-complaint-review-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/quarterly-statistical-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/request-for-review", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/service-plans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/skilledtradescertification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sponsor-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/start-an-apprenticeship", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-information-session-events", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-resources", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-trades-designation-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/strategicplan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/success-stories", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/tax-credits", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-programs-underrepresented-groups", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-providers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/truth-and-reconciliation", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/what-to-expect-on-exam-day", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/youth"]}
