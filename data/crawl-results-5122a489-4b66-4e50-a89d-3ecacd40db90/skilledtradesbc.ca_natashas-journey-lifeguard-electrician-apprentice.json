She recently completed her Level 1 technical training and is thriving as an electrician apprentice.\n\nNatasha Hanson was making a decent living as a lifeguard, but felt the pull to explore something new. Her curiosity led her to quit her job and enroll in an electrical foundation training program at Thompson River University. From the moment she started the program, she enjoyed the hands-on nature and opportunities for growth in the trades. \n\nMidway through her first year, Natasha applied for BC Hydro\u2019s electrician program but didn\u2019t have the prerequisites at the time to secure an interview. Soon after, she learned about [_BC Hydro\u2019s Try-A-Trade program_](https://www.bchydro.com/community/indigenous-relations/opportunities/individuals/try-a-trade.html) for Indigenous candidates. As a proud member of the Williams Lake First Nation, she qualified for the 16-week paid work experience.\n\nThe program included classroom learning and job experience placements at a BC Hydro camp north of Revelstoke, at the Mica Dam and Power Station\u2014one of the world\u2019s largest earth-filled dams.\n\nReflecting on the program, Natasha shared, \u201cIt was a blast. I got to work with almost everybody on the electrical crew \u2014 about 15 electricians and gained a ton of experience!\u201d   \n  \nPrograms like these are one of many across B.C. designed to support women, Indigenous peoples, newcomers and other [_underrepresented groups in the skilled trades,_](https://skilledtradesbc.ca/equity-in-the-trades) helping individuals explore career paths and create meaningful opportunities for themselves.\n\nToday, Natasha has completed her Level One technical training and is thriving as an electrician apprentice.   \n  \nHer employer couldn\u2019t be more proud of her achievements. They shared, \u201cFrom day one, Natasha has approached every challenge with enthusiasm and a willingness to learn. Her work ethic is exemplary, and her growth has been nothing short of inspiring.\u201d \n\nAs one of the few Indigenous apprentices in the organization, she brings unique perspectives that enriches workplace culture, while her journey serves as a powerful example for other aspiring apprentices.\n\n\u201cNatasha\u2019s positive attitude and love for her work motivates those around her,\u201d her employer added. \u201cBy excelling in her role and sharing her story, she inspires others to pursue their passions and contributions to a more equitable future in the trades.\u201d   \n  \nInterested in exploring a career in the skilled trades?\n\n[ Learn More](/become-an-apprentice)\n", "links": ["https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc-corporate-reports/public-interest-disclosure-act", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc/corporate-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/employment-training-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/indigenous-youth", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades/skilledtradesbc-news-feed", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/accessibility-plan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/annual-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/apprentice-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/are-you-impacted", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/become-an-apprentice", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canada-apprentice-loans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canadian-and-military-certificate-holders", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/careers-at-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-certification-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-level-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-skilled-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/contact-us", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/disclaimer", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/employment-insurance", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/equity-in-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-accommodations", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-results", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-rewrites", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-schedule", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/experienced-workers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/find-your-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/fees-payments", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/verify-tradespersons-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/foundation-programs", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/freedom-of-information", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/general-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-about-exams/exam-study-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-skilled-trades-certification/self-assessment-forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/about-exams", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/newcomers-international-tradespersons", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/govt-mandate-letter", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/grants", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/indigenous-people-in-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/labour-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/leadership-team", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/level-challengers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/natashas-journey-lifeguard-electrician-apprentice#main-content", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/new-supports-skilled-trades-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/open-data", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/personal-info-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/policies-and-bylaws", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/privacy-policy", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement/supplier-complaint-review-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/quarterly-statistical-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/request-for-review", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/service-plans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/skilledtradescertification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sponsor-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/start-an-apprenticeship", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-information-session-events", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-resources", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-trades-designation-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/strategicplan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/success-stories", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/tax-credits", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-programs-underrepresented-groups", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-providers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/truth-and-reconciliation", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/what-to-expect-on-exam-day", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/youth"]}
