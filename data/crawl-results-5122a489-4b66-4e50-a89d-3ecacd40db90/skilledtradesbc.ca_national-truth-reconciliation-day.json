From 1831 and 1996, 130 residential schools operated in Canada, with an estimated 150,000 children attending them. Although the records are incomplete, it is estimated that 6,000 children tragically died at the residential schools. \n\nSkilledTradesBC is committed to taking meaningful action towards truth and reconciliation \u2013 on both an organizational-level and encouraging individual staff learning and reflection.
