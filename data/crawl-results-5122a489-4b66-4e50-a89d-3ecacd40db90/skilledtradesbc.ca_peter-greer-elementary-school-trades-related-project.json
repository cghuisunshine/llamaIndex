And that\u2019s what three teachers at Peter Greer Elementary school in Lake Country did to give students some creative learning time at home.\n\nClint Maltais, Matt Olson, and Sara Fletcher are Grade 5 and 6 teachers at Peter Greer Elementary in School District 23 who had been holding after school workshops for teachers in SD 23 before COVID-19 shut down schools. Funded by the SkilledTradesBC, the workshops, says Clint, give teachers basic trades skills that they can pass onto their own students, and hopefully, give them an early interest in trades careers.\n\nStudents at Peter Greer Elementary with their Bee Pollinator Hotel projects\n\n\u201cWe anticipated three more sessions for the school district,\u201d says Clint. \u201cUnfortunately, we weren\u2019t able to do that.\u201d\n\nInstead, they repurposed the unused materials and created fun and educational hands-on projects that their students could assemble at home. The first take-home project was a Bee Pollinator Hotel; a simple project that gives a home to pollinator bees. The teachers measured and pre-cut the wood, packaged the projects, and recorded a how-to video for students to follow along with at home. Then, they lined up the 35 projects outside their classroom door and sent a message out to parents letting them know they could pick them up.\n\n\u201cWithin half an hour, six kits had already been picked up,\u201d says Clint. \u201cThey were all gone by the end of the day.\u201d\n\nThe take-home kits were a huge success. Within days, parents were sharing photos of their kids proudly standing next to their completed projects.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been really good feedback,\u201d says Clint. \u201cIt's an opportunity for families to connect, even siblings were helping.\u201d\n\nClint says that while the trades have often been often considered as a more male-oriented career, the girls in his class showed a big interest in the trades related take-home projects. \u201cWhen exposed early, a lot of the girls are interested in getting out there and using tools.\u201d\n\nThrough continued support from SkilledTradesBC, the school has big plans to make more projects for their students, including a circuit maze, and a simple wooden birdhouse.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping with the next project that they could start measuring and sawing,\u201d says Clint.\n", "links": ["https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-skilledtradesbc",
