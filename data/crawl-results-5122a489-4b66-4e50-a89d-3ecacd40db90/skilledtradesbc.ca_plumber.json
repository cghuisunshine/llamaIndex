They also install specialized systems such as medical gas, process piping, compressed air, water conditioners, fuel piping, sewage and water treatment, and storage and flow equipment. Plumbers interpret drawings, refer to layouts of existing services, and review applicable codes and specifications to determine work details and procedures. They locate and mark positions for fixtures, pipe connections and sleeves, and cut openings to accommodate pipe and fittings. Regulations concerning the planning, installation, maintenance and inspection of sewage treatment systems may vary by jurisdiction. Additional certification may be required in some jurisdictions to allow plumbers to plan and perform work on these systems.
