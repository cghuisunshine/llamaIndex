This includes:\n\n  * SkilledTradesBC IDs\n\n  * Transcripts\n\n  * Certificate Numbers\n\n  * Work-based training hours\n\n  * Exam bookings\n\n  * Document replacement\n\n  * Fee payments\n\n  * And more.\n\n\n\n\nTo see the latest updates on the postal service disruption, visit the [Canada Post website.](https://www.canadapost.ca/cpc/en/our-company/news-and-media/service-alerts.page)\n\nApprenticeship Registration\n\nApprenticeship registration packages, including the Certificate of Apprenticeship, are being held and mailed as soon as Canada Post resumes their services. \n\nIn the meantime, apprentices and sponsors can find a confirmation of registration through their Portal accounts and emails. \n\nTrade Certificates\n\nTrade certificates are currently being held until Canada Post resumes their services. \n\nIn the meantime, journeypersons with certificates issued after January 28, 2009 can view their certificate numbers through their Portal account. If you hold certificates issued in B.C., you can also submit a Portal inquiry or contact Customer Service to retrieve their certification information.\n\nEligible tradespersons who are applying for the Apprenticeship Completion Grant (ACG) and require their certificates should submit their ACG application on or before March 31, 2025, even if they have not received supporting documents, as recommended by Service Canada. The deadline for submitting supporting documents is 12 months from the application deadline date. Visit the [Service Canada website](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/jobs/training/support-skilled-trades-apprentices/grants.html) for more information.\n\nIf you require a B.C. issued tradesperson\u2019s certificate to be verified, use the SkilledTradesBC [Verify a Tradesperson\u2019s Certification tool](https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/verify-tradespersons-certification) on our website. Alternatively, you can contact Customer Service for verification services by providing the journeyperson's full name, trade name, and certificate number.\n\nWe\u2019re Here to Help\n\nIf you have any questions or require support, please contact our Customer Service team at [customerservice@skilledtradesbc.ca](mailto:customerservice@skilledtradesbc.ca) or call 778 328 8700 or 1 866 660 6011 (toll-free in BC).\n", "links": ["https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc-corporate-reports/public-interest-disclosure-act", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc/corporate-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/employment-training-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/indigenous-youth", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades/skilledtradesbc-news-feed", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/accessibility-plan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/annual-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/apprentice-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/are-you-impacted", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/become-an-apprentice", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canada-apprentice-loans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canadian-and-military-certificate-holders", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/careers-at-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-certification-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-level-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-skilled-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/contact-us", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/disclaimer", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/employment-insurance", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/equity-in-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-accommodations", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-results", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-rewrites", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-schedule", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/experienced-workers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/find-your-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/fees-payments", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/verify-tradespersons-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/foundation-programs", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/freedom-of-information", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/general-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-about-exams/exam-study-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-skilled-trades-certification/self-assessment-forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/about-exams", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/newcomers-international-tradespersons", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/govt-mandate-letter", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/grants", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/indigenous-people-in-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/labour-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/leadership-team", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/level-challengers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/new-supports-skilled-trades-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/open-data", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/personal-info-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/policies-and-bylaws", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/postal-service-disruption#main-content", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/privacy-policy", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement/supplier-complaint-review-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/quarterly-statistical-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/request-for-review", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/service-plans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/skilledtradescertification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sponsor-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/start-an-apprenticeship", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-information-session-events", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-resources", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-trades-designation-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/strategicplan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/success-stories", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/tax-credits", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-programs-underrepresented-groups", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-providers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/truth-and-reconciliation", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/what-to-expect-on-exam-day", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/youth"]}
