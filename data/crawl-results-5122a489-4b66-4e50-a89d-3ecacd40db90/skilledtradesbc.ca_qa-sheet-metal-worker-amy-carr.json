I enjoy sharing with others what it is I do and how multifaceted my craft is! There are so many avenues of employment with this trade and with being a union member. Mentorship, leadership, problem solving skills and teaching are my favorite aspects that I was not expecting with my ticket. \n\nI had a few good mentors through my apprenticeship and trades journey. Some were foremen, owners, and coworkers but there weren't any female trailblazers (yet) in my union or trade. Our numbers are growing and it's definitely become a passion project growing and supporting women in all trades. \n\n**Why is it important to you for women to participate in the skilled trades?**\n\nI honestly think its important for anyone and everyone who wants to participate to be given a chance to try trades and see if its a good fit for their career. Many people have no idea what's out there or they perceive trades as a harsh career based on past stereotyping. I truly believe there is a place for everyone in the trades but you wont know until you try or you're given an opportunity to try! \n\n**What advice or message do you have for girls and women interested in pursuing a career in the trades?**\n\nWhat have you got to lose? Seriously if you try it and hate it you still leave with so many skills that can help you with basic every day items. Math, measuring, using hand tools, power tools, and computers. I wish I had started earlier and I wish I had gone for dual Red Seal tickets. In BC we are very lucky as there is a whole trades women army of amazing humans from all walks of life, trades and locations; who are ready, willing and able to support you on your trades journey. \n", "links": ["https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc-corporate-reports/public-interest-disclosure-act", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc/corporate-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/employment-training-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/indigenous-youth", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades/skilledtradesbc-news-feed", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/accessibility-plan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/annual-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/apprentice-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/are-you-impacted", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/become-an-apprentice", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canada-apprentice-loans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canadian-and-military-certificate-holders", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/careers-at-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-certification-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-level-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-skilled-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/contact-us", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/disclaimer", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/employment-insurance", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/equity-in-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-accommodations", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-results", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-rewrites", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-schedule", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/experienced-workers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/find-your-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/fees-payments", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/verify-tradespersons-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/foundation-programs", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/freedom-of-information", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/general-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-about-exams/exam-study-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-skilled-trades-certification/self-assessment-forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/about-exams", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/newcomers-international-tradespersons", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/govt-mandate-letter", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/grants", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/indigenous-people-in-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/labour-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/leadership-team", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/level-challengers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/new-supports-skilled-trades-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/open-data", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/personal-info-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/policies-and-bylaws", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/privacy-policy", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement/supplier-complaint-review-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/qa-sheet-metal-worker-amy-carr#main-content", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/quarterly-statistical-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/request-for-review", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/service-plans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/skilledtradescertification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sponsor-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/start-an-apprenticeship", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-information-session-events", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-resources", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-trades-designation-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/strategicplan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/success-stories", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/tax-credits", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-programs-underrepresented-groups", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-providers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/truth-and-reconciliation", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/what-to-expect-on-exam-day", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/youth"]}
