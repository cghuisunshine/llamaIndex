Inspired by his family and his enjoyment for working on projects whether at his shop at home or at work, he is now living out his dream as a Heavy Duty Equipment Technician apprentice.\n\nRyan Kaetler is a Heavy Duty Equipment Technician apprentice who has been fascinated with tools since childhood, tinkering with anything mechanical he could get his hands on.\n\nHis passion for the skilled trades has been fueled by a strong family influence. Trades careers run in the family\u2014his father works as a welder and his brother as a mechanic. From a young age, Ryan shadowed his dad in the shop, learning to repair everything from bicycle to trucks and automobiles. \n\n\u201cI've always liked using my hands to solve problems and thinking outside the box,\u201d Ryan explains. \u201cMy brother is a Red Seal mechanic, and I've always looked up to him \u2014 both for life skills and mechanical knowledge.\u201d\n\nUnlike many young people who explore different career options, Ryan held a clear vision for his future career in trades. He signed up for his high school\u2019s trades foundation program and carefully chose his courses that allowed him to graduate early and begin his trades journey as soon as possible.\n\nTo those contemplating turning a hobby into a career in skilled trades, Ryan offers practical advice: \u201cFind out what aspect of trades you enjoy the most, then get your foot in the door. From there, get as much experience as possible and keep learning.\u201d\n\nThe variety of trades work and the fulfillment of problem-solving keeps Ryan motivated. \u201cWhat excites me is gradually gaining expertise after starting a project with limited knowledge. I enjoy using what I\u2019ve learned and applying it to the next project.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Ryan works full time at Pilon Tool Rentals while advancing through his second-year apprenticeship. In his free time, he works on personal projects\u2014rebuilding his truck from the original frame and doing repair works for his neighbours. Looking ahead, he plans to earn his Red Seal certificate in Heavy Duty Equipment Technician and potentially pursue a second Red Seal in either electrical or welding.\n\n[ Learn more about the Heavy Duty Equipment Technician trade](/heavy-duty-equipment-technician)\n", "links": ["https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc-corporate-reports/public-interest-disclosure-act", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc/corporate-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/employment-training-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/indigenous-youth", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades/skilledtradesbc-news-feed", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/accessibility-plan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/annual-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/apprentice-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/are-you-impacted", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/become-an-apprentice", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canada-apprentice-loans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canadian-and-military-certificate-holders", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/careers-at-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-certification-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-level-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-skilled-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/contact-us", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/disclaimer", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/employment-insurance", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/equity-in-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-accommodations", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-results", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-rewrites", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-schedule", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/experienced-workers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/find-your-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/fees-payments", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/verify-tradespersons-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/foundation-programs", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/freedom-of-information", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/general-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-about-exams/exam-study-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-skilled-trades-certification/self-assessment-forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/about-exams", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/newcomers-international-tradespersons", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/govt-mandate-letter", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/grants", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/heavy-duty-equipment-technician", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/indigenous-people-in-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/labour-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/leadership-team", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/level-challengers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/new-supports-skilled-trades-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/open-data", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/personal-info-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/policies-and-bylaws", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/privacy-policy", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement/supplier-complaint-review-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/quarterly-statistical-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/request-for-review", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/ryan-kaetler#main-content", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/service-plans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/skilledtradescertification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sponsor-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/start-an-apprenticeship", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-information-session-events", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-resources", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-trades-designation-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/strategicplan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/success-stories", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/tax-credits", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-programs-underrepresented-groups", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-providers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/truth-and-reconciliation", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/what-to-expect-on-exam-day", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/youth"]}
