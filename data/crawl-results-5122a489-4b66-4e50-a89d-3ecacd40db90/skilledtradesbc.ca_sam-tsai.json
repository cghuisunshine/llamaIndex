I want to be a role model that you don't have to scam and take advantage of others to do well in life. Treat others well and they will one day do likewise.\n\nMeet Sam Tsai, a certified Red Seal plumber, gasfitter apprentice, and avid marathon runner who loves the benefits that come with a skilled trades career. \u201cThe everyday troubleshooting, problem-solving, and ever alternating jobs made the 5 years it took to get certified at age 20 feel like just a couple amazing summers\u201d\n\n**How did you first hear about the skilled trades and what inspired you to pursue it as a career?**  \nUpon being approached by a great individual who I would later know as my mentor, sponsor, and \u201cBoss Man\u201d. I fell in love with the specialized side of plumbing and gasfitting. The everyday troubleshooting, problem-solving, and ever alternating jobs made the 5 years it took to get certified at age 20 feel like just a couple of amazing summers. I love being able to serve each customer in a unique way catered to their needs as I inspect and repair issues daily.\n\n**Describe what you love most about the skilled trades?**  \nI love to problem solve and find better and effective ways to complete a task. I love chatting with customers and going the extra two steps to ensure a good reputation and long-term customer. I enjoy explaining to each customer what exactly was done so they don't feel cheated. I love watching and learning from other trades professionals, and most of all I simply love to serve.\n\n**What do you enjoy doing in your spare time?**  \nI enjoy cooking for friends, playing volleyball with my brothers, and chatting late into the night. I also love to run! From 7:30-4:30, I\u2019m on the clock, and anytime before or after that, I'm probably marathon training. (or playing with my niece)\n\n**What are you most proud of?**  \nI'm most proud of my relationships: my family raised me, my community mentored me, my teachers instructed me, and my friends supported me. I would not be where I am today as a certified Plumber and Gasfitter apprentice, and self-supporting at age 20 without their support. \n\n**What advice would you give to people who are considering joining the skilled trades?**  \nIf you aren't sure just try it out, it would never be a negative thing. Even if you don't decide to pursue that trade two years down the road, it still looks great on a resume and the price of trade school will never be beaten. The skilled trades are always a valuable career, and it never hurts to make yourself valuable as an employee.\n\n**Where do you see yourself in 10 years?**  \nI would love to run a successful company in the future and relay the morals and high-tier service that I was taught as a young apprentice. I want to be a role model that you don't have to scam and take advantage of others to do well in life. Treat others well and they will one day do likewise.\n", "links": ["https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc-corporate-reports/public-interest-disclosure-act", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc/corporate-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/employment-training-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/indigenous-youth", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades/skilledtradesbc-news-feed", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/accessibility-plan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/annual-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/apprentice-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/are-you-impacted", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/become-an-apprentice", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canada-apprentice-loans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canadian-and-military-certificate-holders", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/careers-at-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-certification-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-level-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-skilled-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/contact-us", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/disclaimer", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/employment-insurance", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/equity-in-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-accommodations", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-results", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-rewrites", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-schedule", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/experienced-workers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/find-your-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/fees-payments", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/verify-tradespersons-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/foundation-programs", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/freedom-of-information", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/general-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-about-exams/exam-study-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-skilled-trades-certification/self-assessment-forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/about-exams", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/newcomers-international-tradespersons", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/govt-mandate-letter", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/grants", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/indigenous-people-in-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/labour-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/leadership-team", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/level-challengers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/new-supports-skilled-trades-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/open-data", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/personal-info-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/policies-and-bylaws", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/privacy-policy", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement/supplier-complaint-review-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/quarterly-statistical-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/request-for-review", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sam-tsai#main-content", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/service-plans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/skilledtradescertification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sponsor-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/start-an-apprenticeship", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-information-session-events", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-resources", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-trades-designation-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/strategicplan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/success-stories", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/tax-credits", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-programs-underrepresented-groups", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-providers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/truth-and-reconciliation", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/what-to-expect-on-exam-day", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/youth"]}
