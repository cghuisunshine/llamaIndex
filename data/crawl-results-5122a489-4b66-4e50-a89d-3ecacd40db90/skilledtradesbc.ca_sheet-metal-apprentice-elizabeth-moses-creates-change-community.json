She is passionate about inspiring more women and underrepresented groups to explore a career in the skilled trades, and building a more diverse, inclusive workforce. \n\nWhen Elizabeth Moses describes sheet metal work \u2013 her eyes light up and you can hear in her voice how excited and curious she is about her trade. Not unlike most tradespeople, she is proud of her career and very passionate about her trade and it shows in her day-to-day work as a Level 2 sheet metal apprentice and an advocate for women in trades. Elizabeth\u2019s skilled trades career journey hasn\u2019t been without challenges as a woman of colour in trades traditionally represented by men but in her eyes, those challenges fueled her passion to make more space for her and other women in the rewarding world of skilled trades.\n\nElizabeth\u2019s path to skilled trades was rooted from her experiences in high school, where she learned early on that she had an aptitude for hands-on work (Woodworking) and STEM-related activities (Robotics team). After high school she chose to follow the skilled trades career path, not only to pursue her interests but for financial peace of mind with the ability to earn while you learn throughout the whole training journey. \n\n![Elizabeth Moses posing with her award, named as one of ABC women's Top 100 Accomplished Black Canadian Women](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-02-24%20102203.jpg) _Elizabeth accepting her award as one of 100 Accomplished Black Canadian Women in 2024._\n\nFamily, friends and teachers were surprised about Elizabeth\u2019s choice to pursue a skilled trades career. They were concerned about the barriers she might face as a woman of colour in trades. \n\nPerhaps those people would be pleasantly surprised to learn that Elizabeth is now a certified machinist and Level 2 Sheet Metal apprentice and has received many accolades for her ambassadorship for women in STEM and skilled trades. Elizabeth has been named by Women\u2019s Executive Network (WXN) as one of Canada\u2019s Most Powerful Women (Skilled Trades Category), recognized by 100 Accomplished Black Canadian Women in 2024 and has been a keynote speaker at the 2024 Canadian Coalition of Women in Science, Engineering, Trades and Technology conference. She is also currently a co-chair of Build TogetHER (BC Building Trades\u2019 women\u2019s committee).\n\nAnd this tradesperson is just getting started. \n\nElizabeth is proud to be a mentor and trailblazer in the industry and doesn\u2019t take the role lightly. Representation matters for so many reasons and Elizabeth is happy to be a part of the change that will continue to raise the profile of skilled trades and attract more people of colour and women to trades careers.\n\n\u201cIt's hard to envision yourself in places that you don't see others like you. I still have those struggles of\u2026being a double minority, being a black woman, and also just being a trades woman. But you know what? I'm seeing more women and that is awesome to me. I'm certain there will be a lot more women in this industry over time and that's something I'm very happy about.\u201d \n\nShe further reflected, \u201cI'm learning from a lot of great individuals who have done this for so long, who have been in trades for more than 10-20+ years. We talk about a lot of different things, from the challenges of the trades, how we can make a difference in our communities and what we can do together as a board to give back.\u201d\n\n[February is Black History Month in Canada](/black-history-month), a time to celebrate the tremendous contributions that Black Canadians, both past and present, have made in our communities, while paving the way for a more inclusive future. \n\nWe asked Elizabeth what this month means to her.\n\n_\u201cBlack History Month means recognizing everyone before us, recognizing the triumphs, all the challenges we face as a community and what we have overcome. But we also have to keep in mind you can celebrate Black history every single day and every single month. It's not just one month in the year that Black people are significant. We are important in every aspect, in ourselves as individuals.\u201d _\n\nElizabeth is a powerful voice for positive momentum and change. She is embodying the very representation she seeks in communities and is there in leadership roles to champion skilled trades, for everybody. \n\n_Photo Source: Moses, Elizabeth [@metalingliz] (Sept, 29, 2024)_\n\n[ ]()\n", "links": ["https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc-corporate-reports/public-interest-disclosure-act", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc/corporate-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/employment-training-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/indigenous-youth", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades/skilledtradesbc-news-feed", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/accessibility-plan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/annual-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/apprentice-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/are-you-impacted", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/become-an-apprentice", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/black-history-month", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canada-apprentice-loans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canadian-and-military-certificate-holders", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/careers-at-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-certification-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-level-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-skilled-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/contact-us", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/disclaimer", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/employment-insurance", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/equity-in-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-accommodations", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-results", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-rewrites", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-schedule", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/experienced-workers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/find-your-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/fees-payments", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/verify-tradespersons-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/foundation-programs", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/freedom-of-information", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/general-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-about-exams/exam-study-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-skilled-trades-certification/self-assessment-forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/about-exams", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/newcomers-international-tradespersons", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/govt-mandate-letter", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/grants", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/indigenous-people-in-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/labour-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/leadership-team", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/level-challengers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/new-supports-skilled-trades-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/open-data", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/personal-info-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/policies-and-bylaws", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/privacy-policy", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement/supplier-complaint-review-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/quarterly-statistical-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/request-for-review", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/service-plans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sheet-metal-apprentice-elizabeth-moses-creates-change-community#main-content", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/skilledtradescertification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sponsor-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/start-an-apprenticeship", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-information-session-events", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-resources", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-trades-designation-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/strategicplan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/success-stories", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/tax-credits", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-programs-underrepresented-groups", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-providers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/truth-and-reconciliation", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/what-to-expect-on-exam-day", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/youth"]}
