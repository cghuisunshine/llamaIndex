Provincial winners proceed to the Nationals, and then the World competitions. \n\nLeading up to the event, she practiced every single day with her best friend, who was also a competitor. \u201cI was extremely nervous and made many mistakes during practice,\u201d she admits, \u201cbut on the day of competition, everything just clicked.\u201d For Shoshawna, it\u2019s like the world around her went silent and she was fully focused on the task at hand. \u201cI was ahead of schedule; nothing went wrong, and I actually finished early.\u201d When it came time for the award ceremony, Shoshawna was in shock when they announced her as the first-place winner. \u201cI was just amazed! I did not think that would happen... To this day it still shocks me! I know I worked hard, but sometimes you can be your own worst critic,\u201d expressed Shoshawna. \n\n![Apprenticeship Advisor handing a certified tradesperson a Red Seal pin to recognize their achievement.](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Image%20%283%29.jpg) _SkilledTradesBC Apprenticeship Advisor David presents Shoshawna with her Red Seal pin._\n\nWinning the gold medal not only elevated her confidence, but it also opened many doors for her. With this new accolade on her resume, she found herself in high demand among employers, and it empowered her to continue in her education. This past fall, she achieved her Red Seal certification. \u201cNot only does it recognize my credentials, but it\u2019s kind of the proof in the pudding that I\u2019m doing it and I\u2019m doing it well!\u201d \n\nToday, Shoshawna thrives in her dual roles, balancing her days as a Social Media and Program Coordinator with SCBC, and her evenings spent baking for her clients in her rented kitchen. After the competition in 2017, she began volunteering for SCBC as an alumna, which paved the way to her current role, primarily on the coordination side working with competitors. As she looks to the future, Shoshawna hopes to one day open her own bakery, continue her work with the organization, and perhaps teach the next generations of aspiring bakers.   \n  \nShe encourages students and apprentices to participate in these competitions. \u201cIt\u2019s such an amazing experience and a great opportunity to meet other apprentices, tradespeople, and industry professionals. It\u2019s not just about winning; you don\u2019t need to leave with a medal because you\u2019ll leave with the knowledge and connections.\u201d \n\nEach year, SCBC helps thousands of students explore rewarding careers in the skilled trades and technology sectors through skills competitions, hands-on programs for students and resources for educators.  \nTo learn more,[ visit the Skills Canada BC website. ](https://skillscanada.bc.ca/)\n\n**It's never too early to get started in the skilled trades.**\n\n[ Learn More.](/youth)\n", "links": ["https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc-corporate-reports/public-interest-disclosure-act", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc/corporate-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/employment-training-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/indigenous-youth", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades/skilledtradesbc-news-feed", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/accessibility-plan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/annual-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/apprentice-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/are-you-impacted", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/become-an-apprentice", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canada-apprentice-loans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canadian-and-military-certificate-holders", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/careers-at-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-certification-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-level-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-skilled-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/contact-us", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/disclaimer", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/employment-insurance", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/equity-in-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-accommodations", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-results", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-rewrites", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-schedule", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/experienced-workers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/find-your-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/fees-payments", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/verify-tradespersons-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/foundation-programs", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/freedom-of-information", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/general-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-about-exams/exam-study-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-skilled-trades-certification/self-assessment-forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/about-exams", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/newcomers-international-tradespersons", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/govt-mandate-letter", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/grants", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/indigenous-people-in-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/labour-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/leadership-team", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/level-challengers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/new-supports-skilled-trades-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/open-data", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/personal-info-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/policies-and-bylaws", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/privacy-policy", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement/supplier-complaint-review-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/quarterly-statistical-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/request-for-review", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/service-plans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/shoshawna-blair-skills-canada-bc-gold-medalist-red-seal-baker#main-content", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/skilledtradescertification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sponsor-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/start-an-apprenticeship", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-information-session-events", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-resources", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-trades-designation-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/strategicplan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/success-stories", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/tax-credits", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-programs-underrepresented-groups", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-providers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/truth-and-reconciliation", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/what-to-expect-on-exam-day", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/youth", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/youth-train-in-trades-program"]}
