We want to thank and acknowledge all apprentices and businesses for their hard work and valuable contributions to B.C.\u2019s economy, industries and communities.\n\nIt has been nearly a year since Industry Training Authority became SkilledTradesBC and the start of the province\u2019s move toward Skilled Trades Certification, also known as compulsory trades, for seven electrical and mechanical trades. With implementation coming up in a month, we\u2019d like to provide you with some updates on what\u2019s to come.\n\nIt\u2019s Time to Take Action\n\nWith one month left until implementation, it\u2019s important for those who work in one of the seven [Skilled Trades Certification trades](/skilledtradescertification) to get ahead of the changes and take action to meet the requirements. \n\n  * Construction Electrician\n\n  * Industrial Electrician\n\n  * Powerline Technician\n\n  * Pipefitter/Steamfitter\n\n  * Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Mechanic\n\n  * Gasfitter Class A and Class B\n\n  * Sheet Metal Worker\n\n\n\n\nStarting December 1, 2023, [Skilled Trades Certification](/skilledtradescertification) requires workers in the selected trades to be either registered as an apprentice, a certified journeyperson or be issued a temporary authorization. Employers need to ensure their employees who carry out work described in scope of work of Skilled Trades Certification trades meet the requirements. \n\nNew Portal Functionality for Skilled Trades Certification\n\nIn order to make the process easier for workers and employers to get on the pathway to Skilled Trades Certification, we\u2019ve added new functionality on the [SkilledTradesBC Portal](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/Account/Login/Register) for workers with extensive experience to submit an online application to challenge the final certification exam or apply for temporary authorization as an uncertified experienced worker. \n\nThis self-service tool also allows users to track their application status, book their exam, log work hours, and more. Signing up for the Portal allows you to be notified of the latest updates and easily access support from our customer experience team. \n\nUpcoming Virtual Information Sessions\n\nWe will be hosting virtual information sessions in the upcoming weeks for those who are impacted so they can better understand what steps they\u2019ll need to take. We encourage anyone who\u2019d like to learn more or has questions to attend these sessions.
