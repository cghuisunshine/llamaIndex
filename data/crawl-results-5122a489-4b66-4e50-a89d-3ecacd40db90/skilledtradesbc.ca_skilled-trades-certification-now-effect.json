If you are an affected employer or worker, it\u2019s not too late to take action. \n\nA year ago, Industry Training Authority was [renamed SkilledTradesBC](/introducing-skilledtradesbc) by the provincial government and was given an expanded mandate, including the implementation of Skilled Trades Certification, also known as compulsory trades. \n\nAs of December 1, 2023, the first seven Electrical and Mechanical trades have now been implemented. If you are an affected employer or worker, it\u2019s not too late to take action. It\u2019s important to understand what you need to do in order to meet the requirements and SkilledTradesBC is here to help guide anyone with questions or who requires support.\n\nThe seven trades now designated as Skilled Trades Certification trades are:\n\n  * Construction Electrician \n\n  * Industrial Electrician \n\n  * Powerline Technician \n\n  * Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Mechanic\n\n  * Gasfitter Class A & B\n\n  * Steamfitter/Pipefitter\n\n  * Sheet Metal Worker\n\n\n\n\nUnregistered and uncertified workers in these seven trades are required to be registered as an apprentice or be a certified journeyperson. Employers with workers in any of the Skilled Trades Certification trades need to ensure adequate on the job learning and supervision by maintaining the 2:1 apprentice to journeyperson ratio.\n\nOnline Forms Now Available on Portal \n\nWorkers can now register with SkilledTradesBC and submit online forms through the Portal. The [_SkilledTradesBC Portal_](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/ \"https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/\") is a self-service web tool that offers a seamless and efficient way for users to submit their applications, track its status, and manage their apprenticeship and Skilled Trades Certification-related tasks from both their computers and mobile phones. \n\nOnline features are now available for: \n\n  * [_Apprentices_](/become-an-apprentice \"https://skilledtradesbc.ca/become-an-apprentice\") : Workers with less than one year of experience registering their apprenticeship with a sponsor. \n\n  * [_Trade Qualifiers_](/experienced-workers-stc-trades \"https://skilledtradesbc.ca/experienced-workers\") : Experienced workers applying to write the final certification exam in their trade and get their Red Seal or Certificate of Qualification. Applicable to eligible trades only. \n\n  * [_Uncertified Experienced Workers_](/experienced-workers-stc-trades \"https://skilledtradesbc.ca/experienced-workers\") : Highly experienced workers applying to be issued a Temporary Authorization to continue working in their trade for up to 5 years before moving off the tools. Applicable to Skilled Trades Certification trades only. \n\n\n\n\nOnce Trade Qualifiers and Uncertified Experienced Workers have applied online, they may continue working in their trade while waiting for their results. Upon approval, they will receive a Temporary Authorization, allowing them to work toward the requirements without interruption. \n\nNew: Employer Workforce Submission\n\nSkilledTradesBC has introduced a new Employer Workforce Submission for all employers of workers in Skilled Trades Certification trades to share more details about their workforce. The information gathered will be used to identify workers and employers in Skilled Trades Certification trades, help in understanding more about their existing workforce and provide assistance to those who may need support in meeting the requirements. \n\nEmployers who do not have an organizational profile yet on the customer portal can now [sign up for a new account](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/Account/Login/Register) and complete the Employer Workforce Submission as part of the registration process. \n\nEmployers who already have a Portal account will see a pop-up message appear the next time they [log in](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn), requesting workforce information to be filled out. \n\nTo learn more about how you can prepare to answer the form, [visit our employer page](/stc-employers). \n\nAsk Questions and Get in Touch\n\nSkilled Trades Certification Advisors are located throughout the province to provide support and are on hand to help businesses and workers transition to Skilled Trades Certification.
