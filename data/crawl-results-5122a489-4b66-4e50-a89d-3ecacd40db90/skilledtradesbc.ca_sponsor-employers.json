According to the Canadian Apprenticeship Forum, employers receive an average positive return of 35-43 cents for every dollar they invest in apprenticeship training, depending on the trade.

Follow these 7 steps to success.\n\nRecruit (and hire) an apprentice\n\nStart your search through these channels:\n\n  * Connect with trade/industry associations or unions \n\n  * Reach out to your local secondary school; refer to our [list of school districts](/connect-with-a-school) offering SkilledTradesBC Youth in Trades Programs\n\n  * Contact [Indigenous Skills and Employment Training service providers](/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/employment-training-support), First Nations band offices or Tribal Councils who can also connect you with prospective apprentices\n\n  * Advertise for openings on your website, job search websites or social media\n\n\n\n\nEmployers:\n\n  * Ask your employees if they know someone who is interested in becoming an apprentice\n\n\n\n\nRegister as a sponsor\n\nOnce you\u2019ve found an apprentice, register as a sponsor by creating a [SkilledTradesBC Portal account](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/Account/Login/Register?registrationType=certified) and fill out the registration form for your apprentice. You can expect confirmation of registration in ten business days.\n\nAlternatively, your apprentice can fill out the registration form from their Portal account. If so, you will receive a notification to review and approve their registration request within 30 days.\n\n**Note** : If you employ workers in a [Skilled Trades Certification (Compulsory) trade](/skilledtradescertification), you will be prompted to complete a mandatory [Employer Workforce Submission](/stc-employers) and provide information related to your workforce. \n\nEnsure a workplace environment that facilitates learning \n\nAs a sponsor\u2014and working with the employer, if applicable\u2014you are responsible for ensuring:\n\n  * Your apprentice has proper equipment and understands the safety standards of their workplace \n  * Your apprentice knows which certified journeyperson (or equivalent) is responsible for supervising their work-based training \n  * Your apprentice receives work-based training that incorporates the full scope of the trade \n\n\n\nWork together with the supervising journeyperson and apprentice to create a structured training plan. Search for the apprentice\u2019s trade using [Find Your Trade](/find-your-trade) and review the Program Outline (often near the middle of the page) to inform the training plan. \n\nTrack and report your apprentice\u2019s work-based training hours\n\nAs a sponsor, you must track your apprentice's hours on the job and report them through the [SkilledTradesBC Portal](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn/) regularly, ideally every three to six months. About 80 per cent of your apprentice\u2019s training time will be at work. One hour on the job is equal to one hour of work-based training.\n\nYour apprentice may accumulate work-based training hours while working for you and/or for another employer. Work-based training hours must be completed under the direct supervision of a certified or SkilledTradesBC-approved tradesperson. \n\nIf you require additional staff members to help submit work-based training hours or manage your Portal account, make sure to assign the appropriate Portal user roles to ensure they have the access they need. See our [user guides for more details](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/knowledgebase/).\n\nReview and confirm your apprentice\u2019s information\n\nAs a sponsor, you are responsible for reviewing your apprentice's official records and reporting any discrepancies to SkilledTradesBC. \n\nWe will send updated apprentice training transcripts to both sponsors and apprentices when: \n\n  * The apprentice completes a level of technical training \n  * The apprentice challenges a level exam \n  * The apprentice or sponsor notifies us of a change in sponsorship \n  * If there is no activity reported for an apprentice for 12 months\n\n\n\nRelease your apprentice for in-class technical training\n\nAbout 20 per cent of your apprentice's training time will be in the classroom, which includes both theoretical and practical assessments. \n\nEmployer support is required to make it possible for apprentices to attend in-class technical training. This may include releasing apprentices from work for the duration of the class. Talk to your apprentice early on and work together to determine the best options for training times. \n\nThe first level of technical training is generally scheduled one year after registering as an apprentice. If your apprentice has been working in the trade for some time, a shorter interval may be appropriate. We recommend scheduling technical training once a year throughout an apprenticeship to get a balance of theory and on-the-job practical experience. \n\nClasses fill up quickly, so encourage your apprentice to register as early as possible to secure a seat for technical training with a [SkilledTradesBC-designated training provider](/all-approved-training-providers-list). \n\nRecommend certification\n\nOnce your apprentice has completed both their work-based and technical training and passed the certification exam, SkilledTradesBC will ask you to provide a Recommendation for Certification to attest that your apprentice is now working at the skill level of a certified journeyperson. \n\nOnce we receive your recommendation, we will send you the certificate package to sign and present to your apprentice. \n\n**If you decide not to recommend your apprentice for certification:**\n\n  * You must provide the reasons and a training plan to remedy any skill and knowledge deficiencies, including a suggested date for SkilledTradesBC to send another Recommendation for Certification form. \n  * You are responsible for communicating with your apprentice about your decision and plan. \n\n\n\n![](/sites/default/files/2022-11/SKILLED%20TRADES_09082022_0094.jpg)\n\nSubject Matter\n\nExperts\n\nHelp us develop and revise trades programs and exams by participating in
