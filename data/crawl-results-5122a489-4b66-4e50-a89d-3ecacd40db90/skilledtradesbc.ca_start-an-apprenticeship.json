Each trade has a mandatory number of work-based training hours required at each level and for certification. \n\n**In-class Technical Training** 20%\n\nThe classroom is where you learn the technical knowledge to complement your work-based training. It must be completed through a [SkilledTradesBC-designated training provider](/all-approved-training-providers-list). Depending on the trade, there may be multiple levels of technical training required, and trade programs include Standard Level Exams. \n\n**Certification**\n\nAfter you\u2019ve completed both your work-based and in-class technical training, you will need to successfully write a certification exam and obtain a Recommendation of Certification from your sponsor to be officially certified!\n\n## \n\nStep-By-Step Guide for Your Apprenticeship Journey\n\nFind your trade \n\nNot sure where to start? [Take our quiz](/find-your-trade-quiz) and explore the best trades for you.\n\nBrowse the specific trade pages and review the Program Profile (often near the middle of the trade page) carefully. Pay attention to details like how many levels of in-class technical training you need, the number of hours you\u2019ll need to work to get certified. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve selected a trade, you may want to consider signing up for the trade\u2019s [Foundation Program](/foundation-programs) to gain some experience and familiarity with a trade before finding a sponsor for your apprenticeship. \n\nFind your sponsor and employer \n\nEvery apprentice has both, and in most cases, the sponsor and employer are the same person or organization. The sponsor is responsible for helping you get opportunities to learn on the job and reporting how many work-based training hours you acquire; the employer hires you and pays for your work. \n\nBuilding a good working relationship with them is important to make sure the investment in your apprenticeship benefits everyone. Communication is key\u2014make sure that both you and your employer and/or sponsor understand your own responsibilities as well as the requirements for you to achieve certification. If anything is unclear, [ask an Apprenticeship Advisor](/contact-us).\n\nRegister as an apprentice\n\nOnce you\u2019ve found a sponsor, register your apprenticeship by [creating a SkilledTradesBC Portal account](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/Account/Login/Register). Ensure that your sponsor has also created an account so that they can confirm your registration.\n\nRegister to attend in-class technical training\n\nThe classroom is where you will pick up the technical knowledge to complement your work-based training. Make sure to register as early as possible to secure a seat for technical training with a [SkilledTradesBC-designated training provider](/all-approved-training-providers-list). \n\nYour trade program may be available at a school in your community or you may have to travel to relocate for a couple of weeks each year. [Trades Training BC](https://www.tradestrainingbc.ca/) and [EducationPlannerBC](https://www.educationplannerbc.ca/) provide helpful search tools to find where your trade program is being offered across the province. \n\nWe recommend scheduling your in-class technical training once a year throughout your apprenticeship to get a balance of theory and on-the-job practical experience. It\u2019s important to communicate with your employer about the best time to be away from work for in-class technical training. \n\nEnsure you apply for Employment Insurance (EI) to receive the benefits while attending in-class technical training. \n\nAccumulate and track your work-based training hours \n\n[Sign into your SkilledTradesBC Portal account](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn/) regularly to make sure the hours you have worked are being reported by your sponsor. We recommend sponsors to report your work-based training hours every 3-6 months. Please note that only sponsors are able to report your hours.\n\nPass your certification exam\n\nOnce you\u2019ve completed all levels of your in-class technical training, you will be tested on your entire apprenticeship through a certification exam. Your instructor will spend time on exam preparation, including a review of the theory from all levels. Take advantage of this, spend time to review your training materials, [gather study resources](/get-certified-about-exams/exam-study-support) and consider [applying for an exam accommodation](/exam-accommodations) if you require additional support. \n\nIf you do not get a pass mark of 70 per cent or higher, we provide [rewrite](/exam-rewrites) opportunities to help you achieve certification.\n\nObtain your certification\n\nAfter you\u2019ve completed both your work-based and in-class technical training, including passing the certification exam, SkilledTradesBC will ask your sponsor and the certified journeyperson (or equivalent) who supervised you to provide a Recommendation for Certification (RFC) to confirm that you are working at the skill level of a certified journeyperson.\n\nOnce we receive their recommendation, we will send the certificate package to your sponsor to sign and present, making you officially certified! \n\n![Automotive Service Technicians in garage working on hood of cars](/sites/default/files/2024-07/AST_GarageTeam.jpg)\n\nCreate a SkilledTradesBC Portal account and register your apprenticeship\n\n[ Create a Portal Account](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/Account/Login/Register)\n\n## \n\nResources for Apprentices\n\n#### [Financial Support If you need financial assistance, there are several options\u2014including grants, loans and tax credits\u2014that you may be eligible for.
