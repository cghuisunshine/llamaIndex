Applications may come from B.C. businesses, labour organizations, industry associations, Indigenous organizations and communities that work in, or have an interest in, the trades. \n\nA maximum of ten trades are being assessed to move from the application to the detailed assessment phase.

The applications that are identified to move forward then undergo a more detailed assessment which will take several months and result in a recommendation to government for consideration. Applicants will be notified if their nominated trade will progress to the detailed assessment phase in early September. It is important to note that SkilledTradesBC is using specific criteria to assess all trades nominated including identifying alignment within existing frameworks including if either a trade is: 1) currently regulated in BC, or 2) readily aligns to trades already identified as BC STC trades. SkilledTradesBC will also limit the number of trades that proceed to the detailed assessment phase to a maximum of ten (10). \n\nWho can apply for a trade to become a designated STC trade?\n\nThis is an open process and applications may come from B.C. businesses, labour organizations, industry associations, Indigenous organizations and communities that work in, or have an interest in, the trades.\n\nWho can provide letters of support?\n\nThe application requires a minimum of two letters of support \u2013 one letter from a small-sized employer (1-49 employees) and one letter from a medium-sized employer (50-499 employees). \n\nEmployers must employ tradespersons and/or sponsor apprentices.\n\nApplicants may also submit two additional letters optionally from other organizations such as Indigenous communities or training providers. \n\nHow many trades will be chosen as a Skilled Trades Certification trade and when will they be announced?\n\nA maximum of 10 trades will be selected to move from the application phase to the detailed assessment phase. The final trades will be announced by the Government of B.C. in spring 2024. \n\nIf an organization would like to nominate multiple trades, will they need to complete separate applications?\n\nYes, each organization will need to complete a separate application for each trade nomination they make. If you know other organizations who are nominating a trade your organization is also interested in nominating, we encourage you to work together and consider writing a letter of support. \n\nWhat area of the BC Government will be approving the applications?\n\nNear the end of the STC Trades Designation process, SkilledTradesBC will be recommending up to 10 trades to our Board and the Ministry of Post-Secondary Education and Future Skills for consideration.\n\nWill there be more trades selected after the initial round and in the future?\n\nThere may be an opportunity to nominate additional trades in the future; however, no new applications will be accepted until the review and assessment phases conclude on the first round of applications and recommendations for STC designation have been submitted to government.
