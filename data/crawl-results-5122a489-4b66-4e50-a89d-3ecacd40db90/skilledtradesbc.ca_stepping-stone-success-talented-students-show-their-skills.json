From Automotive, Cabinetmaking, Cooking to Metal and Pipe Trades, students put in the hard work to earn a spot and showcase their skills in front of judges and spectators. \n\nThe path for some started with discovery or introductory classes which inspired future participation in training programs. Those initial experiences help plant the seed to participate in specialized training helping them grow into potential Skills Canada BC competitors in the future. \n\nOne of the students that participated at the Camosun regionals was Natalie Alexa, a grade 11 student from Edward Milne Community School (EMCS), who enthusiastically stepped up to compete in the Welding category. \n\nNatalie\u2019s journey into the trades began through EMCS\u2019s Metal Trades Awareness Skills & Knowledge (TASK) class, a hands-on SkilledTradesBC Youth Explore the Trades Sampler program that introduces young students to trades like carpentry, electrical, plumbing and metalwork. Encouraged by supportive shop teachers, like Matt Harmison and Justin Chapel, and inspired by her boyfriend, who is also a welder, Natalie found her spark in welding and hasn\u2019t looked back since. \u201cIt\u2019s something I enjoy doing. I\u2019m excited to get up in the morning to go to work, knowing I get to weld, figure out new skills and expand everything.\u201d\n\nReflecting on her experience at the 2025 Skills Canada Regional Competition, Natalie admitted the preparation time leading up to the event was tough, especially while balancing a busy school schedule. Her dedication to be competition-ready pushed her to find time between classes, during lunch breaks and even after school to be able to practice her welding skills. Despite the nerves on competition day, she walked away with valuable lessons and a sense of accomplishment. \u201cTake your time,\u201d she advises future competitors. \u201cIn the end, you were there, you were present and that\u2019s what matters.\u201d \n\nYouth programs and opportunities such as TASK and Skills Canada competitions have an important role in providing youth with early exposure to skilled trades and the rewarding career pathways they offer. Natalie would not have considered a career in welding if not for these programs. Now she is registered in the Welder Foundation Program for 2026 and has plans to gain more work experience over the summer. Because of her determination, community support and a clear passion for the trade, Natalie is setting herself up for success in the welding industry.\n\n_SkilledTradesBC facilitates a variety of youth-oriented programs to get students to learn about skilled trades.
