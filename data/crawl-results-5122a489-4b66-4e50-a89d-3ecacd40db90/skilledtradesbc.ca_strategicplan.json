We also considered how to ensure the plan reflects the needs of our community around responsiveness to climate change, commitment to Truth and Reconciliation as well as championing equity, diversity and inclusion.\n\nWe didn\u2019t build this plan alone. We had conversations with apprentices, employees, partners, stakeholders and community members including industry, training providers, Indigenous groups, unions and associations who all play a pivotal role in ensuring our vision and plan are successful. \n\nFinally, our Strategic Plan was built with direction from the Ministry of Post-Secondary Education and Future Skills, to ensure it serves our mandate from the Minister and meets government\u2019s areas of focus, while also providing flexibility to evolve as our province and community continue to grow in the short and long term.\n\n[ Download Strategic Plan](/media/2178/download)\n\nOur Vision\n\nAn inclusive, world-class skilled trades workforce that meets the needs of British Columbians.\n\n![](/sites/default/files/2023-08/SKILLED%20TRADES_09132022_150.jpg)\n\n## \n\nOur Goals\n\nOur goals define what success looks like and bring our strategy to life.
