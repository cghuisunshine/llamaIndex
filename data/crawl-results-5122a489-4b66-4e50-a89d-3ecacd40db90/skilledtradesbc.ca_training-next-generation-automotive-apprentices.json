Over the years, he has trained and mentored over 20 mechanics who completed their entire apprenticeship at the dealership and received their Red Seal, unlocking a career that has allowed them to raise families and buy a home. \n\nNot only has it been rewarding for Jessie to see these individuals grow up, but hiring apprentices is important for business. \u201cHiring young apprentices gives them a good jump start in their automotive career, and it gives us an opportunity to land some pretty good talent in the trade, which is getting harder and harder to come by,\u201d said Jessie.\n\n[![](/sites/default/files/inline-images/JB%20pic.jpg)](https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sites/default/files/inline-images/JB%20pic.jpg) _Jessie Bloomfield_\n\n[A study](https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023PSFS0062-001818) funded by B.C. government and Canadian Apprenticeship Forum - Forum Canadien sur l\u2019Apprentissage shows that apprenticeships bring real business value and contribute to a sustainable workforce for employers.  According to the research, employers receive an average positive return of 35 to 43 cents for every dollar they invest in apprenticeship training, depending on the trade. \n\nFor those who are unsure about joining the skilled trades, Jessie emphasizes that the trades are a career that will always be around. \u201cin our case, As long as companies are going to be making cars, there will always be a need for maintenance and repairs. It\u2019s something that allows people to provide for themselves and their family for their life. It\u2019s not just a job, it\u2019s a career.\u201d\n\nTo continue finding new workers for his business, Jessie has been partnering with the local school district of Comox Valley since 2004. His relationship with the school district has allowed him to get an idea of which students show a strong interest in joining the trades after graduation. \n\nOne of his current apprentices, Kegan Labreque, received a call from Jessie after graduating high school. Kegan\u2019s interest in cars stemmed from his father, who is also in the skilled trades, and taking an automotive trades sampler program when he was in 10th grade. \n\n![Automotive apprentice working on car](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Keagan%20-%20AST%20apprentice.jpg) _Above: Kegan working at Brian McLean Auto_\n\n\u201cI've always liked cars, and I found that working on them was really, really fun for me,\u201d said Kegan. \u201cThe trade sampler helped me get into the industry, get some work experience, and learn the fundamental basics. Then I decided that that's what I wanted to do for a career.\u201d\n\nKegan starts his Level 1 technical training next month in August. Eventually, his goal is to complete his apprenticeship and become Red Seal certified. \n\nWhen asked what keeps him motivated at work, Kegan cites that it\u2019s learning every day. \u201cBecause there's always something to learn and new things to do, I can keep progressing. I'm excited to learn, try new things, and work on more interesting stuff. I like challenges and problem solving, so that really keeps me motivated to progress in the automotive trade and explore everything it has to offer.\u201d\n", "links": ["https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc-corporate-reports/public-interest-disclosure-act", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc/corporate-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/employment-training-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/indigenous-youth", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades/skilledtradesbc-news-feed", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/accessibility-plan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/annual-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/apprentice-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/are-you-impacted", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/become-an-apprentice", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canada-apprentice-loans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canadian-and-military-certificate-holders", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/careers-at-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-certification-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-level-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-skilled-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/contact-us", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/disclaimer", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/employment-insurance", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/equity-in-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-accommodations", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-results", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-rewrites", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-schedule", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/experienced-workers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/find-your-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/fees-payments", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/verify-tradespersons-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/foundation-programs", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/freedom-of-information", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/general-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-about-exams/exam-study-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-skilled-trades-certification/self-assessment-forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/about-exams", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/newcomers-international-tradespersons", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/govt-mandate-letter", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/grants", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/indigenous-people-in-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/labour-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/leadership-team", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/level-challengers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/new-supports-skilled-trades-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/open-data", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/personal-info-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/policies-and-bylaws", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/privacy-policy", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement/supplier-complaint-review-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/quarterly-statistical-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/request-for-review", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/service-plans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/skilledtradescertification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sponsor-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/start-an-apprenticeship", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-information-session-events", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-resources", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-trades-designation-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/strategicplan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/success-stories", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/tax-credits", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-next-generation-automotive-apprentices#main-content", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-programs-underrepresented-groups", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-providers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/truth-and-reconciliation", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/what-to-expect-on-exam-day", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/youth"]}
