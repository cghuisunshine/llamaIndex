The CCDA is undertaking the Harmonization Initiative, with 30 Red Seal trades completed by 2020. British Columbia is an active participant in this initiative. \n\nThe goal is to substantively align apprenticeship systems across Canada by making apprenticeship training requirements more consistent in the Red Seal trades. \n\nAs part of this work, the CCDA identified the following harmonization priorities in consultation with industry and training stakeholders: \n\n  * Use the Red Seal trade name \n\n  * Consistent number of training levels \n\n  * Consistent total trade hours (in-school and on-the-job) \n\n  * More consistent technical training \n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Phases\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION TARGET SEPTEMBER 2024**\n\n  * Baker\n\n  * Tower Crane Operator\n\n  * Automotive Service Technician (Post-Harmonization Implementation*)\n\n  * Floorcovering Installer (Post-Harmonization Implementation*) \n\n* \u201cPost-Harmonization Implementation\u201d means that these trades have already been harmonized. The standards will be reviewed and updated, but changes to the four harmonized elements, (i.e., trade name, number of levels, total trade hours and sequencing) are not anticipated. \n\n\n\n\nImplemented Trades\n\n**PHASE 1 - RED SEAL TRADES SELECTED FOR HARMONIZATION**\n\nStrong industry and stakeholder engagement has resulted in significant progress in harmonizing the first group of Red Seal trades. Changes have been implemented in most jurisdictions for 2016 & 2017 intakes: \n\n  * Carpenter \n\n  * Welder \n\n  * Metal Fabricator (Fitter) \n\n  * Ironworker (Generalist) \n\n  * Ironworker (Reinforcing) \n\n  * Mobile Crane Operator \n\n  * Tower Crane Operator \n\n\n\n\n**PHASE 2 - 8 RED SEAL TRADES SELECTED FOR HARMONIZATION**\n\n  * Automotive Service Technician \n\n  * Construction Electrician \n\n  * Heavy Duty Equipment Technician \n\n  * Industrial Electrician \n\n  * Industrial Mechanic (Millwright) \n\n  * Plumber \n\n  * Steamfitter/Pipefitter \n\n  * Truck and Transport Mechanic \n\n\n\n\n**PHASE 3 - 5 RED SEAL TRADES HARMONIZED BY SEPTEMBER 2018**\n\n  * Boilermaker \n\n  * Sprinkler System Installer \n\n  * Concrete Finisher \n\n  * Landscape Horticulturist \n\n  * Sheet Metal Worker \n\n\n\n\n**PHASE 4 - 5 RED SEAL TRADES HARMONIZED BY SEPTEMBER 2019**\n\n  * Rig Technician \n\n  * Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Mechanic \n\n  * Insulator (Heat and Frost) \n\n  * Machinist \n\n  * Tool and Die Maker \n\n\n\n\n**PHASE 5 - 5 RED SEAL TRADES HARMONIZED BY SEPTEMBER 2020**\n\n  * Cook \n\n  * Powerline Technician \n\n  * Motor Vehicle Body Repairer (Metal and Paint) \n\n  * Automotive Painter \n\n  * Hairstylist \n\n\n\n\n**PHASE 6 - RED SEAL TRADES HARMONIZED BY SEPTEMBER 2021**\n\n  * Instrumentation and Control Technician \n\n  * Partsperson \n\n  * Bricklayer \n\n  * Glazier \n\n  * Roofer \n\n  * Motorcycle Mechanic \n\n\n\n\n**PHASE 7 - RED SEAL TRADES HARMONIZED BY SEPTEMBER 2022**\n\n  * Cabinetmaker \n\n  * Lather (Interior Systems Mechanic) \n\n  * RVST \n\n  * Mobile Crane Operator (Post-Harmonization Implementation*) \n\n  * Construction Electrician (Post-Harmonization Implementation*) \n\n  * Industrial Electrician (Post-Harmonization Implementation*) \n\n  * Metal Fabricator (Fitter) (Post-Harmonization Implementation*) \n\n  * Carpenter (Post-Harmonization Implementation*) \n\n\n\n\n* \u201cPost-Harmonization Implementation\u201d means that these trades have already been harmonized. The standards will be reviewed and updated, but changes to the four harmonized elements, (i.e., trade name, number of levels, total trade hours and sequencing) are not anticipated. \n\n**PHASE 8 - RED SEAL TRADES HARMONIZED BY SEPTEMBER 2023**\n\n  * Painter and Decorator \n\n  * Transport Trailer Technician (Post-Harmonization Implementation*) \n\n  * Steamfitter/Pipefitter (Post-Harmonization Implementation*) \n\n  * Heavy Duty Equipment Technician (Post-Harmonization Implementation*) \n\n  * Truck and Transport Mechanic (Post-Harmonization Implementation*) \n\n  * Plumber (Post-Harmonization Implementation*) \n\n\n\n\n* \u201cPost-Harmonization Implementation\u201d means that these trades have already been harmonized. The standards will be reviewed and updated, but changes to the 4 harmonized elements, (i.e., trade name, number of levels, total trade hours and sequencing) are not anticipated. \n\nConsultation Process\n\nThe Pan-Canadian Harmonization initiative involves discussion and consultation with industry stakeholders connected to each trade. For each Red Seal trade, industry is engaged at the national and provincial/territorial levels to propose and validate recommendations for harmonization. These consultations take the form of face-to-face meetings, webinars and electronic information distribution. \n\nSkilledTradesBC begins each round of Red Seal harmonization activity with a survey that is distributed to every sponsor registered by trade. This survey explains the recommendations being made to the CCDA as they apply to trade name, number of training levels and total trade hours across Canada. Sponsors are invited to complete the survey and these results are summarized and shared at the national level, compared with other provinces, and they contribute to a draft Red Seal Occupational Standard. Interested Sponsors and Training Providers then can participate in further discussion around the sequencing of technical training content through national webinars and provincial workshops. \n\nIf you have any questions, please contact [Customer Service](/contact-us). \n", "links": ["https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc-corporate-reports/public-interest-disclosure-act", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc/corporate-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/employment-training-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/indigenous-youth", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades/skilledtradesbc-news-feed", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/accessibility-plan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/all-approved-training-providers-list", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/annual-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/apply-approved-training-provider", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/apprentice-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/are-you-impacted", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/become-an-apprentice", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canada-apprentice-loans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canadian-and-military-certificate-holders", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/careers-at-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-certification-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-level-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-skilled-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/contact-us", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/disclaimer", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/employment-insurance", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/equity-in-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-accommodations", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-results", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-rewrites", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-schedule", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/experienced-workers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/find-your-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/fees-payments", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/verify-tradespersons-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/foundation-programs", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/freedom-of-information", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/general-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-about-exams/exam-study-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-skilled-trades-certification/self-assessment-forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/about-exams", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/newcomers-international-tradespersons", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/govt-mandate-letter", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/grants", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/indigenous-people-in-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/labour-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/leadership-team", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/level-challengers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/new-supports-skilled-trades-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/open-data", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/personal-info-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/policies-and-bylaws", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/privacy-policy", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement/supplier-complaint-review-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/program-standards-updates", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/quarterly-statistical-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/request-for-review", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/service-plans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/skilledtradescertification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sponsor-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/start-an-apprenticeship", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-information-session-events", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-resources", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-trades-designation-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/strategicplan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/success-stories", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/tax-credits", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-programs-underrepresented-groups", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-providers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-providers/non-public-approved-training-providers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-providers/pan-canadian-harmonization-initiative", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-providers/pan-canadian-harmonization-initiative#main-content", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/truth-and-reconciliation", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/what-to-expect-on-exam-day", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/youth"]}
