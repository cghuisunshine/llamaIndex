This two-day event brought together local youth from diverse backgrounds to learn culinary skills from experienced chefs.\n\nThe Thrive-4-Blacks Youth Culinary Festival, held on June 28 and 29 at [DIVERSEcity Surrey Community Campus](https://www.dcrs.ca/about-us/our-story/) was a vibrant celebration of food, culture and community. This two-day event brought together 20 local youth, aged 9-19, from diverse backgrounds, offering them a unique opportunity to develop culinary skills while exploring the vibrant flavours of African and Caribbean cuisines.\n\nParticipants were divided into three teams and guided by chefs, Cullin David ([Calabash Bistro](https://www.calabashbistro.com/)), Nicholas Simon ([Maureen Simon Foods](http://maureensimonfoods.com/)) and Ekaose Mon-John Nwadiani ([VanSuya](https://vansuya.ca/)). Each team selected their ingredients, prepared their cooking stations, and learned the techniques and methods to create dishes such as Nigerian Jollof rice and Akara, Ghanaian Jollof rice, and Jamaican hot pepper soup, among others. As they cooked, they also delved into the rich history and cultural significance of each dish. The event was inclusive of all skill levels, offering valuable knowledge and hands-on experience that enriched each participant\u2019s understanding of both cooking and culture.   \n\n\n![People on either side of a table serving food buffet style](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture1.jpg) _Team Pink led by Chef Ekaose Mon-John Nwadiani serving their delicious dishes to judge Maureen Simon of Maureen Simon Foods._\n\nChef Andrew George, Director of Truth and Reconciliation at SkilledTradesBC participated as a judge and spoke to the students about his own journey as an Indigenous person and his path to becoming a Red Seal Chef. \u201cApprentices are walking into a whole new culinary world nowadays.\u201d Andrew shared. \u201cThe most important message I can give is to be proud of who you are and your heritage. You have a rightful place at the table, and if you like cooking, this is your opportunity to showcase your culture on the plate!\u201d\n\nWith over 40 years of experience, Chef Andrew highlighted how French techniques have shaped modern cooking standards and practices. However, in recent years, there has been [a notable shift towards embracing diverse global cuisines and cultural influences](/celebrating-milestones-nlcs-inaugural-professional-cook-indigenous-cohort-concludes-first-year), underscoring the importance of diversity and inclusion not only in cooking \u2013 but in all aspects of life. \n\n![person standing at podium speaking into microphone](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Thrive4blacks-0059_0.jpg) _Chef Andrew George speaking to participants._\n\n  \nIn addition to culinary experience, participants learned about the broader world of skilled trades. SkilledTradesBC staff connected with students, answered their questions, and provided guidance to those interested in exploring the trades and apprenticeship pathway. \n\n\u201cWe want to make sure youth from all backgrounds have an opportunity to learn about skilled trades and do it in a fun hands-on way,\u201d shared Maureen Phung, Manager of Youth Programs at SkilledTradesBC. The event was a huge success, with participants leaving energized and many expressing a desire to pursue careers as chefs or to further their education in cooking.  \n  \n[Thrive-4-Blacks Community Services Society](https://thrive4blacks.org/) is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to supporting and uplifting Black communities through various initiatives including educational programs, cultural events, and community-building activities.
