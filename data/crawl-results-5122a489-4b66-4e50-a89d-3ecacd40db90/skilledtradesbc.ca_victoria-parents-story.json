She reflects on her family's journey to learn, understand, and start the apprenticeship journey and what her son's future might look like. \n\n![Victoria - A Parent's Story](/sites/default/files/2023-11/Victoria%20still.png)\n\n__ Play\n\n__\n\nVictoria - A Parent's Story\n\nWatch an interview with a parent of a Youth in Trades Program participant and learn about how their family came to learn and understand about skilled trades careers and the benefits of an apprenticeship.\n\n[ Watch the interview](https://youtu.be/bnMeAWv4-E4)\n\n## \n\nExtended Content\n\nWhat practical aspects should parents be prepared for?\n\nThe amount of clothing that they need for their particular trade, initially equipping your child is very expensive.\n\nWhen you think about safety equipment, boots and basic tools - they need that part. I thought, 'oh, the employer will just give them all the tools.' And that's not really how it works. As I've come to learn, my garage is full of tools. \n\nI think with the electrical trade too, something that surprised us was the amount of math. Kevin did do Pre-Calculus and Physics in high school, and it really gave him an advantage. I had heard, you know, 'Oh, they should do workplace math.' And I think there was a real benefit to doing the more challenging Pre-Calculus and Physics, because a lot of the electrical trade is based on those skills of being able to solve mathematical problems and physics problems. \n\nWhat emotional aspects should parents be prepared for?\n\nI think emotionally, just being able to support your child go through the process of learning of doing hands on work and being really physically tired after a long day. \n\nI think some of the stress of not knowing if they'll fit into a worksite depending on which trade they go into, you know, they could be working with a small team of people or a big team, and they're continually as an apprentice, they're continually being moved around to different journeymen. And I think emotionally that could be really stressful for a lot of young people. They need to have good social skills. I think supporting them through that of how to meet people, how to connect with people, how to communicate effectively is super important. I think also there aren't as many young people going into skilled trades as there should be.  \n  \nEmotionally there's that questioning piece like should I be doing this? Is this right for me? It's a long journey that they need to figure out how to go through. Just supporting them and listening and knowing when you don't have to fix things for them, but they just need to work through it themselves.  \n  \nThat's a hard part for a parent, is to let our young people go forward. We have to really recognize that some of the things that they worry about aren't necessarily things that we need to worry about and knowing when to just listen. And that can be really hard. I think that really going into the trades is a no brainer.\n\nDo you have any other advice or guidance for parents/guardians?\n\nIf your if your child expresses an interest in doing something a little bit different or isn't really sure what they want to do, I think in the very least, doing some kind of trade sampler or doing a first year program, going out there and giving it a try is the only way to know whether this is a fit or not.\n\nI think very quickly they discover that it is or is not based on maybe their expectations, their own abilities, their interests, and so much more. But I don't think you can really rule it out. And I know way back in the beginning we have two amazing people who really talked to the young people and said, think of this as a way forward, that this is just the beginning of your journey.\n\nYou go into this Youth Program, you try out the trade, you start making money right away. You earn as you go. And even as they're learning, they're still earning money. When they finish with their program, then it can be a stepping stone into so many other things. It can be a stepping stone into other career potentials, into creating their own business, that it's not just the you get your trade in.\n\nYou get your trade and then who knows what happens after that. You know, you become a teacher of the trades. You become an independent businessperson. You join a bigger corporation. There's lots of potential there. And I think I really want parents to know that it can really open up a lot of doors if their child is the right fit for it.\n", "links": ["https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/SignIn/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc-corporate-reports/public-interest-disclosure-act", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-about-skilledtradesbc/corporate-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/employment-training-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades-indigenous-peoples-trades/indigenous-youth", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/about-trades/skilledtradesbc-news-feed", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/accessibility-plan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/annual-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/apprentice-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/are-you-impacted", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/become-an-apprentice", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canada-apprentice-loans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/canadian-and-military-certificate-holders", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/careers-at-skilledtradesbc", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-certification-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-level-exam", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/challenge-skilled-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/contact-us", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/disclaimer", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/employment-insurance", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/equity-in-the-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-accommodations", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-results", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-rewrites", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/exam-schedule", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/experienced-workers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/financial-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/find-your-trade", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/fees-payments", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/forms-registration/verify-tradespersons-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/foundation-programs", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/freedom-of-information", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/general-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-about-exams/exam-study-support", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified-skilled-trades-certification/self-assessment-forms", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/about-exams", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/get-certified/newcomers-international-tradespersons", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/govt-mandate-letter", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/grants", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/indigenous-people-in-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/labour-mobility", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/leadership-team", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/level-challengers-stc-trades", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/new-supports-skilled-trades-certification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/open-data", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/personal-info-record-request", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/policies-and-bylaws", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/privacy-policy", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement/supplier-complaint-review-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/quarterly-statistical-reports", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/request-for-review", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/service-plans", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/skilledtradescertification", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/sponsor-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/start-an-apprenticeship", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-employers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-information-session-events", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-resources", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-trades-designation-process", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/strategicplan", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/success-stories", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/tax-credits", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-programs-underrepresented-groups", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/training-providers", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/truth-and-reconciliation", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/victoria-parents-story#main-content", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/what-to-expect-on-exam-day", "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/youth"]}
