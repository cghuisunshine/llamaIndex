Huntington's disease has been successfully\n[0:00:04.800] treated for the first time according to the results of a trial that has just been released.\n[0:00:09.760] This disease is one of the worst genetic disorders. It's often described as a mixture\n[0:00:14.480] of dementia, Parkinson's and motor neuron disease. Here in the UK, it affects around 7,000 people.\n[0:00:20.160] Now, if you inherit the gene from either parent, there is a 50% chance you will develop it,\n[0:00:25.840] usually developing it in middle age. The trial was shown to slow the progress of the disease by\n[0:00:31.680] 75%. So with me now is our medical editor Fergus Walsh and Professor Edward Wilde,\n[0:00:37.360] who is a consultant neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and a\n[0:00:41.680] Huntington's disease specialist. Isn't it great to see you both talking about this story? And\n[0:00:47.119] Fergus, we are always so careful to use that word breakthrough. It's rare I use it. But we can,\n[0:00:52.880] I have had to pinch myself on this story a little bit in your intro. If you inherit this gene\n[0:01:00.799] from one of your parents, there's 100% chance you will go on to develop Huntington's disease.\n[0:01:09.120] So when couples have a child, there's a 50-50 chance that it'll be passed on. But this trial,\n[0:01:15.839] and these are just the top line results, so we need to always be cautious until they're\n[0:01:21.040] published in a peer-reviewed journal. But they are sensational. Edward's involved,\n[0:01:26.720] he'll tell you much more. I feel bad even talking before him. But let me just give you the outline.\n[0:01:33.279] 29 patients. They had a one-off treatment, which was an injection into six parts of the brain,\n[0:01:42.400] deep into the brain. And the three-year data shows that of the 29 patients involved,\n[0:01:49.919] the average slowing of the disease was 75%. And that was based on measures like cognition,\n[0:02:00.239] movement, ability to lead an independent life. And given that this awful disease often takes\n[0:02:08.720] 10 to 20 years to kill someone once symptoms emerge, potentially, that could give them\n[0:02:15.199] decades, years certainly, but decades more healthy life. So it's extraordinary. It's not\n[0:02:20.399] licensed yet. But I'm thrilled for researchers like Ed, and also for the families. I've met quite\n[0:02:28.240] a few of the families. And they are living under the shadow of this terrible condition.\n[0:02:34.479] And so it's fantastic news. Ed, as Fergus was speaking, I mean, I just\n[0:02:39.199] went goose lumpy. But then I looked across at your face, and you are looking so utterly thrilled,\n[0:02:43.919] as you should be. I mean, can you give me a reaction from you and the team when you started\n[0:02:48.639] to see these kinds of results come through? I'm probably slightly more prone to excitement\n[0:02:55.759] than Fergus on things like this. But it really is breathtaking. And it's unlike anything we've\n[0:03:00.800] ever seen before. I've been doing Huntington's disease research and looking after patients with\n[0:03:05.520] HD for 20 years. And trial after trial after trial has, you know, we've been in the world of\n[0:03:12.080] incremental progress. But each individual trial has ended in disappointment and a negative result.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3377, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b76f357-3869-464a-89ea-de0497cfd7fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b76f357-3869-464a-89ea-de0497cfd7fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/chenguagnghui/Term3/WebProject2/llama_index/data/2025-09-24-17-55-39.txt", "file_name": "2025-09-24-17-55-39.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6388, "creation_date": "2025-09-25", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9b208603-66fe-419a-afcf-cc7fd98fccb0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/chenguagnghui/Term3/WebProject2/llama_index/data/2025-09-24-17-55-39.txt", "file_name": "2025-09-24-17-55-39.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6388, "creation_date": "2025-09-25", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-25"}, "hash": "b51af71fa598d98e561ebb95ebd89e7043943cd725ddbbc938e197f6f84047b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8a8760b3-8ff0-41fa-8b4c-a0c42d6a2752", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/chenguagnghui/Term3/WebProject2/llama_index/data/2025-09-24-17-55-39.txt", "file_name": "2025-09-24-17-55-39.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6388, "creation_date": "2025-09-25", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-25"}, "hash": "b6aa8cbc4954253dce331f93ddd63037cc06aad71f33c760f149dfabc9104266", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "63d0fdfa-7db4-494c-9cde-9e095c03a4f5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ede8332c629f2a1dbd06e0d517d23717bd7766b207fbf111989f9e9e35b9a04f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "But then I looked across at your face, and you are looking so utterly thrilled,\n[0:02:43.919] as you should be.

And trial after trial after trial has, you know, we've been in the world of\n[0:03:12.080] incremental progress. But each individual trial has ended in disappointment and a negative result.\n[0:03:18.160] We know what we need to achieve, though. We know the cause of Huntington's disease. And that's what\n[0:03:22.240] gave us the head start. And this gene therapy news is really the first time in the history of\n[0:03:29.279] Huntington's disease that we have convincingly slowed the progression of Huntington's disease.\n[0:03:34.479] And we have biochemical evidence that the mechanism is through rescuing neurons, protecting neurons\n[0:03:41.199] from dying, which they would otherwise do. Okay, so tell us a bit more about how it works,\n[0:03:45.039] why it's so effective. So the gene therapy is an inactivated virus, which is injected deep into\n[0:03:51.279] the brain, a part of the brain called the striatum. It's a long neurosurgical procedure. So\n[0:03:57.039] there's a lot of upfront work and risk. Once the gene therapy has been delivered to the brain,\n[0:04:03.679] that's it. It's there, the virus gets into the neurons and injects a piece of DNA. And it\n[0:04:10.000] basically reprograms the neuron to become a factory for its own cure. So the neuron is producing\n[0:04:18.559] the harmful protein, but it's also producing a molecule which halts production of that protein.\n[0:04:24.160] And that must be how we've slowed the disease. There's less harm happening and the disease is\n[0:04:32.160] slower. And just to be clear, Fergus, up until now, doctors have only been able to manage the\n[0:04:37.760] symptoms. Yeah, there's been no treatment for Huntington's disease. This holds the promise\n[0:04:45.040] that not only will you be able to slow it down in patients who are affected in the early stages,\n[0:04:53.040] but yesterday I met a 30-year-old man whose father died of Huntington's disease, saw him\n[0:05:01.040] gradually fade away, needing full-time care, and died at the age of 54.\n[0:05:07.040] There's hope that he will be able to have the treatment and others and never get affected.\n[0:05:13.920] I mean, it's as big as that. Now, I should put this, we've got to be cautious. It's not a licensed\n[0:05:18.320] treatment. It'll be expensive. Another gene therapy, a one-off treatment. Like a million\n[0:05:26.399] pounds sometimes? Probably maybe more than two million. But if you think of the cost,\n[0:05:32.640] Huntington's disease tends to come on when people have just had their children,\n[0:05:38.480] they then need full-time care. It's a huge cost to those families and to society.\n[0:05:45.440] So I would hope the NHS would see this as something that is worth paying for. But obviously,\n[0:05:55.440] there are lots of other demands on the NHS.
